Service assistants report to an administrator and/or professional member of the unit who will supervise and mentor the student.\\nJob duties:\\n- As the service assistant’s duties vary depending on the unit’s specialization, assigned duties should support the student’s academic career and future career-readiness and expectations must be finalized upon hire. Students are anticipated to have the knowledge and/or experience in the area they will be providing service in.\\n- The primary responsibility of a Graduate Administrative Assistant is to provide administrative support to a department. These positions are not eligible to support funded, full-time doctoral students; they are paid hourly and do not include tuition/fee and health insurance support.\\n- As administrative assistant duties vary, job duties and expectations must be finalized upon hire.\\nCriteria:\\n- A Research Affiliate GRA is a full-time doctoral student enrolled in the 9/9/3 SCH sequence and who has been awarded a competitive fellowship, per the criteria listed below. The Research Affiliate GRA is not an employee of the university, but may be eligible to enroll in certain insurance plans that are part of the university's group insurance program as a Research Affiliate (job code A013). Research Affiliates are not eligible to participate in any of the university's retirement programs. To be eligible for the Research Affiliate title, individuals must be directly involved in research activities for UTSA and awarded a competitive graduate student fellowship valued at a total of $18,000 (UTSA minimum) or more annually.\\nEligibility criteria for competitive fellowships:\\n- The fellowship is awarded directly to an individual student by a national or international foundation, non-profit or similar institution (and it is not allowable to be administered by the university), with awards being determined through a competitive review process\\n- The competitive award provides a stipend, either singly or in combination, that is equal or greater than $18,000 (UTSA minimum) annually\\n- Eligible funding programs do not include those awarded from federal, state or industry grants and contracts awarded to the university with faculty investigators.\\n\\nEligibility Requirements\\n\\n- Must be in academic good standing.\\n- Making satisfactory progress toward a graduate degree and meeting all milestones.\\n- Maintain a minimum overall GPA of 3.0.\\n- Full-Time Fully Funded (FFDR) doctoral students must be enrolled full-time, 9 hours in long semester (fall and spring) and 3 hours in summer to be appointed for full graduate assistantship of 19 hours per week.\\n- With prior approval, full-time fully funded (FFDR) doctoral students in their final semester (i.e., the semester in which they will be awarded their doctoral degree and graduate) may be enrolled in one credit and stay eligible for Full Graduate Assistantship Appointment for that semester.\\n- Doctoral students with exceptions for part-time status may be enrolled in a minimum of 6 hours in long semester (fall and spring) and 1 hour in a summer semester to be appointed for a partial graduate assistantship of between 10 and 15 hours per week.\\n- Doctoral students enrolled for less than 6 hours in the long semesters and less than 1 hour in the summer are ineligible for any graduate assistantship appointment.\\n- Minimum enrollment of 6 hours in long semester (fall and spring) and 1 hour in a summer semester to be appointed for up to 19 hours a week.\\n- With prior approval, funded master’s students in their final semester (i.e., semester in which they will be awarded their master’s degree and graduate) may be enrolled in one credit in a long semester.\\n- Graduate students enrolled for less than 6 hours in the long semesters and less than 1 hour in the summer are ineligible for any graduate assistantship appointment.\\n\\n19 Hour Limit\\n\\nCurrently, UTSA policy is to not allow students to work more than 19 hours per week during weeks when classes meet. There are several reasons for this policy.\\nDuring weeks that classes do NOT meet (e.g. Christmas break, Spring break), students may work a maximum of 40 hours per week without prior special permission. During partial break weeks (i.e. Thanksgiving break), students should work no more than 8 hours per day on the days when classes are not in session.\\nDuring the summer, students cannot work more than 19 hours during the 10 week term, regardless of which summer term the student is enrolled.\\nThere is currently no policy regarding a minimum number of hours per week.

Prior to advertising any scholarships, the awarding unit is responsible for checking account balances to verify the availability of funds. The awarding unit should maintain the account and is responsible for the account balances. Scholarships from annual gifts should not be awarded if funds have not been received for the year of award. For endowments, awards can only be made based on the amount of interest to be earned by September 1 of the academic year of the award. Due to funding limitations, not all students meeting the minimum requirements will be awarded a scholarship.\\nAll scholarships administered through colleges, schools, departments or the Scholarship Office should be awarded in a timely manner. If at all possible, scholarships should be awarded no later than May 31. This deadline is necessary to facilitate coordination between the Financial Aid Office and the Scholarship Office in awarding scholarships to students receiving need-based financial aid.\\nAll contributions, including those accepted by colleges, schools, and departments, will be processed through the Development Office. Full reporting and approval procedures for acceptance of private gifts from all sources, including individuals, foundations, and corporations, must be followed. Contact the Development Office for further guidance. All scholarships must have either a signed scholarship agreement from the donor or a Memorandum of Understanding between the coordinating unit and the Development Office.\\nAuthority to approve scholarships/fellowships as competitive on behalf of UTSA is vested with the Vice President for Strategic Enrollment (VPSE) for scholarships and the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies (VPRGS) for fellowships.\\n(a) A student who holds a competitive scholarship of at least $1,000 for the academic year or summer for which the student is enrolled, and who is either a nonresident or a citizen of a country other than the United States of America, is entitled to pay the fees and charges required of Texas residents without regard to the length of time the student has resided in Texas. The student must compete with other students, including Texas residents, for the scholarship, and the scholarship must be awarded by the scholarship committee officially recognized by the administration and be approved by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, under criteria developed by the board.\\n(A) Nonresidents (including citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. and all foreign students) who receive eligible competitive scholarships from their institutions totaling at least $1,000 may be granted a waiver of nonresident tuition for the period of time covered by the scholarship, not to exceed 12 months.\\n(B) To be eligible as the basis of a waiver, the scholarship(s) must meet the following criteria:\\n(D) The total number of students receiving waivers on the basis of competitive scholarships in any given term may not exceed 5 percent of the students enrolled in the same semester in the prior year.\\n(E) If the scholarship recipient is concurrently enrolled at more than one institution, the waiver of nonresident tuition is only effective at the institution awarding the scholarship. An exception for this rule exists for a nonresident student who is simultaneously enrolled in two or more institutions of higher education under a program offered jointly by the institutions under a partnership agreement. If one of the partnership schools awards the student a competitive scholarship-based waiver, the student is also entitled to a waiver at the second institution.\\n(F) If a nonresident or foreign student holds a competitive academic scholarship or stipend and is accepted in a clinical biomedical research training program designed to lead to both a doctor of medicine and doctor of philosophy degree, he or she is eligible to pay the resident tuition rate.\\nThe following steps shall be taken by colleges/schools/departments in order for scholarships/fellowships to be approved as competitive.\\n- The memorandum will state the name of the scholarship, the criteria to be used in awarding the scholarship, and a list of committee members officially authorized to award scholarships. If a private donor established the scholarship, then the criteria listed in the agreement will also be listed in the memorandum.\\n- Once approved, the scholarship must be advertised and available to the public in advance of any application deadline.\\n- List containing the name of the scholarship, account number, recipient names, Banner or student ID number, dollar amount awarded, length of term, and residency status.\\n- List of all applicants for each competitive scholarship containing student's name, ID number, and residency status.\\n- The Scholarship Office will inform Fiscal Services via e-mail and copy the Business Manager's Office and Payroll to waive the non-resident tuition for recipients receiving a competitive scholarship. The Business Manager's Office will have the residency code changed for each nonresident recipient to receive the in-state waiver. The residency code will be changed for the duration of the competitive scholarship not to exceed 12 months. Renewed scholarships beyond the 12-month period are not eligible for the in-state tuition waiver. If students are awarded different competitive scholarships for a subsequent year, they are entitled to the in-state rate. This is the only exception to the 12-month rule. A scholarship may be a single competitive scholarship of $1,000 or a combination of competitive scholarships totaling at least $1,000.\\n- Each year colleges/schools/departments will review their competitive scholarships for possible changes. Changes will be submitted to the VPSA for scholarships or the VPRGS for fellowships. If there are no changes to the program, a list must be submitted containing the names of each committee member for each competitive scholarship.\\n- The Scholarship Office will maintain a list of all approved competitive scholarships/fellowships and ensure awards are disbursed to students in accordance with federal, state and institutional regulations.\\n\\nXIII.

Our teacher candidates have the opportunity to develop their skills, gain experience, and even make mistakes while learning from experienced professionals. Our teacher candidates develop networks and are exposed to potential employers so that when they enter the classroom, they are ready from the first day. Our highly recruited teacher candidates are employed in school districts across the State of Texas and beyond.\\nThe Texas Education Agency reports that our five-year teacher retention rate is above the state average. Our diverse teacher candidates are well-prepared to work with diverse students, including English Learners and special populations; and are prepared to integrate technology into their practices.\\n\\nPride Points\\n\\n- Augmenting support and services to school districts in the San Antonio region through innovative programming including the nationally recognized Dual Language Partnership with the San Antonio ISD, with which we engage collaboratively in prioritizing research-driven pedagogy, instruction, and practices for dual language settings. In accordance with UTSA’s legacy as a community-serving institution, this partnership strives for authenticity, engagement, and reciprocity, capitalizing on the collective assets brought by school district personnel, UTSA faculty/staff, parents, and community stakeholders.\\n- South Bexar Urban School Leaders Collaborative (USLC) Cohort – donor-funded program aimed at preparing equity-conscious principals for historically underserved settings (e.g., SAISD, Edgewood ISD).\\n- Streamlining teacher preparation degree programs (Equity and Education degree) which create options for students to choose either a bilingual or ESL track and reorganize/consolidate curriculum to reduce degree credit requirements (now 120 credit hours). We anticipate that this will address critical skill needs and the teacher labor market.\\n- Working with City Ed Partners and US Prep to facilitate a more rigorous and meaningful clinical teacher experience that includes impactful mentoring and compensated, yearlong residencies.\\n- Collaboration with CAST Teach High School in Northside ISD where HS students earn college credit and take educator preparation courses at UTSA.\\n- The Signature Teacher Residency: We are working with several school districts (Edgewood ISD, Harlandale ISD, Northside ISD, Northeast ISD, San Antonio ISD, Somerset ISD, and East Central ISD) to implement paid residencies for our clinical teachers. These partnerships require that we address teacher preparedness and shortages through shared governance.\\n- UTSA’s Dual Credit Teacher Pathway initiatives: We are working with three school districts (North East ISD, SAISD, and Northside ISD) to implement a dual credit pathway for high school students to enter into teacher education programs. At the moment we’re trying to strengthen these partnerships so that we can maximize the number of high school students who complete the program and actually enter into our teacher education program.\\nThe OPPP supports students pursuing certification and licensure by overseeing accredited programs, and by creating and sustaining partnerships with school districts, community and business entities, hospitals, and other industries.\\nIf you are interested in pursuing a degree or certificate that leads to certification and/or licensure, please follow these links:\\n\\nEducator Preparation (Certification) and Licensure Programs Offered\\n\\n- Undergraduate (60+ Hours) (initial)\\n- Bilingual & ESL specialists\\n- Completed Baccalaureate in another field (computer science, Math, English, etc.)\\n- Secondary (7-12 Grade) (computer science, Math, English Language Arts, etc.)\\n- All level (Art, Music, PE, special Ed.)\\n- Master's Degree with Teacher Certification\\n- School Counselor, Reading Specialist, Principal, Superintendent\\n- Master's degree + Bilingual and ESL Generalists\\n\\nAdvanced Professional\\n\\n- Certification & Licensure\\n- Behavior Analyst, Professional Counselor, School Psychologist, Dietetics\\nThe OPPP supports UTSA’s Bold Futures Initiative and COEHD’s partnership initiatives for optimizing opportunities, transforming lives, and creating endless possibilities for learners, faculty, staff, and community alike. The OPPP ensures that our students and graduates have the appropriate preparation and field practice experiences for attaining their respective certification and/or licensure as well as that our graduates achieve their career/employment goals. Developing and sustaining educational partnerships with school districts, community and business entities, clinics, hospitals, and others are key in supporting the preparation of our students.\\nUTSA has partnered with the Northside ISD and the CAST Network to co-create a funded residency for secondary teacher candidates. The UTSA-NISD Signature Teacher Residency program at CAST Teach High School provides cohorts of secondary certification candidates with extended opportunities to teach, learn, and interact with high school students, teachers, and administrators. Participation in the UTSA-NISD Signature Teacher Residency at CAST Teach High School requires a one-year commitment.\\nApplicants have preferably participated in the pre-clinical UTSA-NISD residency program, though any secondary candidate may apply.\\n- UTSA residency committee reviews applications and makes referrals to NISD\\n- NISD conducts interviews and contacts UTSA with recommendations for accepted residents\\n- UTSA informs candidates of district decisions\\n- Candidate reviews and signs letter of acceptance and returns signed agreement form to UTSA\\n\\nContact for UTSA-NISD Residency information:\\n\\n\\nHave an inquiry about our program?\\n\\nWe appreciate your interest in Professional Preparation and Partnerships and extend our warmest welcome to you.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- Main Building\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nStay Connected to the College of Education and Human Development\\n\\nCOEHD will be an international model for developing inclusive, transformative leaders guided by principles of community, integrity, excellence, scholarship and service.

Students will need the contributor’s name, date of birth, Social Security Number (SSN), and email address to invite them to complete their required portion of the FAFSA. Contributors will need to provide personal and financial information on their section of the FAFSA.\\nIf a dependent student’s parents are unmarried and living together, both parents will be contributors, will need to have separate Federal Student Aid (FSA) IDs, and need to provide consent. Dependent students whose parents filed their U.S. income tax return as Married Filing Jointly only require one parent contributor to complete the FAFSA. If the student’s parents filed separately, both parents will be considered contributors and therefore need separate FSA IDs.\\nIf an independent student is married and filed separately, both individuals are contributors and must have FSA IDs.\\nFor the FAFSA to process successfully, consent must be provided by all required contributors (student, parent, parent spouse, and/or student spouse) on the FAFSA. This allows the Federal Tax Information (FTI) transferred from the IRS to be provided to higher education institutions, state higher-education agencies, and designated scholarship organizations.\\nConsent is provided once for the academic year and cannot be revoked in that academic year. This consent is necessary even if the contributor does not have a Social Security Number (SSN), did not file taxes, or filed taxes in another country. To provide consent, contributors must have an FSA ID.\\nDetermining what parent(s) to include on the FAFSA is changing. Income and assets are to be reported for the parent who provides the most financial support even if the student does not live with that parent or lives with the other parent.\\nIn previous years, if a student’s parents were divorced or separated, the parent with whom the student lived the most in the past 12 months prior to filing the FAFSA was to be listed; however, this is no longer the primary consideration.\\n- Parental income and assets in the case of a student whose parents are married and not separated, or who are unmarried but live together, shall include the income and assets of both parents.\\n- Parental income and assets for a student whose parents are divorced or separated, but not remarried, is determined by including only the income and assets of the parent who provides the greater portion of the student’s financial support.\\n- If either of the parents has died, the surviving parent shall be considered a single parent, unless that parent has remarried.\\n- If both parents have died, the student shall not report any parental income or assets.\\n- If a parent who is divorced or widowed and would be included on the FAFSA has remarried, the income of the parent’s spouse must be included if the student’s parent and the stepparent are married as of the date the FAFSA is completed.\\n- For a single parent who is not divorced, separated, or remarried, the income and assets of the single parent shall be included.\\nTo avoid issues with your FAFSA form, make sure the personal information you enter for your contributor exactly matches the information they provided when creating their StudentAid.gov account. Ensure correct spelling of names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and emails. Differences as small as using “Road” in the invitation to the contributor, versus the contributor using the abbreviation “Rd” when creating their StudentAid.gov account, can potentially lead to errors that will prevent the contributor from entering the FAFSA form. You may check all contact information in the contributor’s account settings.\\nOnce your FAFSA is submitted, it will be processed by the Department of Education. To check your status:\\n- Click on “My Activity”\\n- Select “View FAFSA Submission Summary” to check the status of your FAFSA.\\nThe information you provide on the FAFSA form will be used to offer you federal, state and institutional money at UTSA. Watch the video below to help you prepare to submit your FAFSA.\\nBe prepared to submit your FAFSA form by gathering documents such as tax returns, current balances of cash and savings, and/or other financial support records. Any contributors you invite to your form will need to provide the same information for themselves. Watch this video to learn more.\\nDon’t forget to provide consent when you submit your FAFSA form. It’s required for federal student aid eligibility. This consent allows you to share personal and tax information to determine your financial aid eligibility. Watch this video to learn more.\\nOn average it takes 10 minutes to submit your part of the FAFSA. What do you have to lose? Students who submit their FAFSA may be eligible for scholarships, grants, work-study funds and student loans.

UTSA awards credit for college-level transfer coursework, earned with a grade of “B” or higher, from accredited colleges and universities. Admitted students may submit a petition for credits to the related Graduate Program Committee and academic College to receive credit earned from foreign institutions and non-accredited colleges or universities. Based on course level, rigor, quality, comparability, and degree program relevance, credits may be awarded on an individual basis at the discretion of the Graduate Program Committee, academic College, and the Graduate School.\\nUTSA reserves the right to refuse recognition of credit from a college or university if it is determined the course does not meet the department’s standards of level, rigor, quality, comparability, and degree program relevance. Applicability of such coursework toward the UTSA degree plan is at the discretion of the major academic department. Work counted toward a degree at another institution cannot be transferred.\\nConditions for transfer of credit:\\n- Students must complete the form “Transfer of Graduate Credit towards Master’s Degree.”\\n- Student must be in a current master’s degree program.\\n- Student must be in good academic standing.\\n- The courses must have been completed with a grade of “B” (3.0) or better. Degrees awarded from a Professional School with selected grading systems such as pass/fail must have been completed with a grade of “Pass” or better.\\n- Coursework cannot be used in another degree program.\\n- An official transcript from the institution where the coursework was completed must be submitted.\\n- All coursework must have been completed no more than six years before the degree was awarded.\\n- Coursework is subject to approval of the appropriate Graduate Program Committee and academic College in which the program is administered.\\n- Courses must be defined as graduate-level work at the institution where the credit was earned.\\n- International transcripts must be evaluated by a UTSA approved foreign credential evaluation service agency.\\n\\nTime Limitation\\n\\nAll requirements for a master’s degree must be completed within one six-year period. Work over six years old may be reinstated only with the permission of the Dean of the Graduate School, upon recommendation of the Graduate Program Committee.\\n\\nEvaluation of Courses\\n\\nThe student’s Graduate Advisor of Record and the College evaluate transcripts and designate which graduate courses are acceptable under the above provisions for transfer toward a master’s degree at UTSA. Whether or not a course is transferable as graduate coursework is determined by the course number assigned by the institution awarding the credit. To be transferable to UTSA, courses must be defined as graduate courses at the institution where credit was earned. Courses that are defined as undergraduate upper-division by their course numbers, but that can be applied to a graduate degree at the institution awarding the credit, are not accepted for transfer toward a master’s degree at UTSA. All work submitted for transfer credit must have been completed with grades of “A” or “B” (3.0) and must have been completed no more than six years before the degree was awarded. Competency-based coursework or credit-only courses will not be accepted.\\n\\nTransfers within The University of Texas System\\n\\nIt is the policy of The University of Texas System that all academic institutions within the System may accept graduate credit from each other, and the regular requirements for residency are adjusted accordingly. The applicability of specific courses from other University of Texas institutions to a student’s graduate degree program at UTSA, however, must be approved by the appropriate Graduate Program Committee.\\n\\nCourse Types and Acceptability\\n\\n\\nNot Accepted\\n\\n\\nAudited Courses\\n\\nNo UTSA credit is granted for courses that are audited; no official record is made of enrollment in classes on an audit basis.\\n\\nCorrespondence and Extension Courses\\n\\nCourses completed by correspondence or extension may not be applied to a graduate degree program.\\n\\nCourses Counted for Another Degree\\n\\nNo courses counted toward another degree may be applied to a graduate degree, either directly or by substitution. The only exception is that candidates holding a Master of Arts degree in Art from another institution seeking admission to the Master of Fine Arts degree program may have up to 24 semester credit hours applied toward the M.F.A. degree exclusive of the thesis and/or degree project, upon recommendation of the department Graduate Program Committee and approval of the Dean of the Graduate School.\\n\\nCredit by Examination\\n\\nCredit by examination at UTSA is intended to enable undergraduate students to receive credit for courses leading to a bachelor’s degree in which they may already have achieved the objectives. Credit cannot be earned by CEEB examination or by UT Challenge Examination for any courses used to meet minimum requirements for a graduate degree or graduate teacher certification program.\\n\\nDual Degree Program\\n\\nThe purpose of a dual degree program is to allow students to undertake complementary programs of graduate study simultaneously through curricular arrangements that allow dual credit for a specified set of courses. Dual degree programs lead to two separate diplomas. In most cases, the dual degree program allows students to complete both degrees in a shorter period of time than if they pursued the individual degrees separately. Students must complete the dual degree program within 6 years of the first semester of enrollment.\\n\\nAdmission Requirements\\n\\nStudents must apply and be admitted as degree-seeking to each graduate program separately and abide by all program requirements. Admission to these programs requires the submission of two completed application forms, one for each program. Each program’s entrance requirements must be met in addition to University-wide requirements, and students must be accepted to both programs. As a matter of note, admission requirements established by the Graduate School or by either degree program may not be waived. For example, if one program in the dual degree program requires GRE scores and the other does not, the applicant must take the standardized exam to be considered for admission to the dual degree. Students in a graduate program that later become interested in the dual degree option must contact the Graduate Advisor of Record prior to completing 24 semester credit hours in the program. A graduate committee of at least three faculty must review all applications and make admissions recommendations to the Graduate School dean. Final admission decisions are made by the Graduate School dean. All agreements require Graduate School dean’s signature authority for approval.\\n\\nAcademic Requirements\\n\\nAll grades earned in dual degree status are used for purposes of determining University and program academic good standing, academic probation, and graduate requirements. In addition, students participating in a dual degree program are subject to the policies and procedures of each respective program. A student in a dual degree program who fails to make satisfactory academic progress and is placed on academic probation or is dismissed from the University must consult with both program Graduate Advisors of Record about the future course of action (see Student Policies, General Academic Regulations section). Students who are dismissed from either program are dismissed from the University and are no longer considered to be in a dual degree program.\\nA student who has been dismissed academically may only petition for reinstatement to the program in which they were in good standing when dismissed. If readmitted, the student may enroll in and, if applicable to the program for which the student is eligible to be readmitted, use courses for credit toward the degree program in which they were in good standing when dismissed. Students may not take courses in the program which prompted their dismissal and may not use such courses for dual degree credit. If a student is dismissed from a dual degree program, the student may not be retained or readmitted into the dual degree program.\\n\\nDouble-Counting Credit Hours\\n\\nStudents in dual degree programs may double-count a limited number of credit hours toward the requirements of both degrees. Double-counting of credit hours for two certificate programs is not permitted. Double-counted courses must be taken within six years prior to graduation.\\n- No more than 12 hours may be used jointly when the total number of hours required for both degrees is less than 72 hours.\\n- No more than 18 semester credit hours may be used jointly when the total number of hours required for both degrees is 72 hours or more.\\nDual degrees are only conferred simultaneously. Students may not be awarded an individual degree while in a dual degree program. Should a dual degree student choose to withdraw from one of the two degree programs, the student will have the option of completing the other degree following the normal requirements of that individual graduate program.\\n\\nDual Degree Program with Other Institutions\\n\\nThe purpose of a dual degree program is to allow students to undertake complementary programs of graduate study simultaneously through curricular arrangements that allow dual credit for a specified set of courses. Dual degree programs lead to two separate diplomas. In most cases, the dual degree program allows students to complete both degrees in a shorter period of time than if they pursued the individual degrees separately. Students must complete the dual degree program within 6 years for master’s degree or 8 years for doctoral degree of the first semester of enrollment.\\nStudents must apply and be admitted as degree-seeking to each graduate program separately and abide by all program requirements. Admission to these programs requires the submission of two completed application forms, one for each program. Each program’s entrance requirements must be met in addition to University-wide requirements, and students must be accepted to both programs. As a matter of note, admission requirements established by the Graduate School or by either degree program may not be waived. For example, if one program in the dual degree program requires GRE scores and the other does not, the applicant must take the standardized exam to be considered for admission to the dual degree. A graduate committee of at least three faculty must review all applications and make admissions recommendations to the Graduate School dean. Final admission decisions are made by the Graduate School dean. All agreements require Graduate School dean’s signature authority for approval.\\nAll grades earned in dual degree status are used for purposes of determining University and program academic good standing, academic probation, and graduate requirements. In addition, students participating in a dual degree program are subject to the policies and procedures of each respective program. A student in a dual degree program who fails to make satisfactory academic progress and is placed on academic probation or is dismissed from the University must consult with both program Graduate Advisors of Record about the future course of action (see Graduate Catalog, General Academic Regulations section). Students who are dismissed from either program are dismissed from the University and are no longer considered to be in a dual degree program.\\nStudents in dual degree programs may double-count a limited number of credit hours toward the requirements of both degrees. Double-counted courses must be taken within six years for master’s degree or eight years for doctoral degree prior to graduation. Students must earn a minimum of one third of the semester credit hours required for the UTSA graduate degree at UTSA.\\n\\nOther Requirements\\n\\nDual degrees are only conferred simultaneously. Students may not be awarded an individual degree while in a dual degree program. Should a dual degree student choose to withdraw from one of the two degree programs, the student will have the option of completing the other degree following the normal requirements of that individual graduate program. Additional requirements will include a research capstone project in addition to thesis/dissertation research. This can be in the form of a research paper or an actual research project.\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nPrint Options\\nDownload PDF of the entire catalog\\n\\n'),\n",

These factors result in a higher incidence of accidents and accidental death for such persons than in nonusers of alcohol. Nutrition also suffers, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies are frequent. Prolonged alcohol abuse causes bleeding from the intestinal tract, damage to nerves and the brain, psychotic behavior, loss of memory and coordination, damage to the liver often resulting in cirrhosis, impotence, severe inflammation of the pancreas, and damage to the bone marrow, heart, testes, ovaries, and muscles. Damage to the nerves and organs is usually irreversible. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in alcoholics and is 10 times more frequent than in nonalcoholics. Sudden withdrawal of alcohol from persons dependent on it will cause serious physical withdrawal symptoms. Drinking during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome. Overdoses of alcohol can result in respiratory arrest and death.\\n\\nDrugs\\n\\nThe use of illicit drugs usually causes the same general type of physiological and mental changes as alcohol, although frequently, those changes are more severe and sudden. Death or coma resulting from overdose of drugs is more frequent than from alcohol.\\n\\nCocaine\\n\\nCocaine is a stimulant most commonly inhaled as a powder. It can be dissolved in water and used intravenously. The cocaine extract (crack) is smoked. Users can progress from infrequent use to dependence within a few weeks or months. Psychological and behavioral changes resulting from use include overstimulation, hallucinations, irritability, sexual dysfunction, psychotic behavior, social isolation, and memory problems. An overdose produces convulsions and delirium and may result in death from cardiac arrest. Discontinuing the use of cocaine requires considerable assistance, close supervision, and treatment.\\n\\nAmphetamines\\n\\nPatterns of amphetamine use and its associated effects are similar to cocaine. Severe intoxication may produce confusion, rambling or incoherent speech, anxiety, psychotic behavior, ringing in the ears, hallucinations, and irreversible brain damage. Intense fatigue and depression resulting from use can lead to severe depression. Large doses may result in convulsions and death from cardiac or respiratory arrest.\\n\\nMDA and MDMA (XTC, Ecstasy)\\n\\nThese amphetamine-based hallucinogens are sold in powder, tablet, or capsule form and can be inhaled, injected, or swallowed. They cause similar, but usually milder, hallucinogenic effects than those of LSD. Because they are amphetamines, tolerance can develop quickly, and overdose can happen. Exhaustion and possible liver damage can occur with heavy use. In high doses, these drugs can cause anxiety, paranoia, and delusions. While rare, these drugs have been associated with deaths in users with known or previously undiagnosed heart conditions.\\n\\nRhohypnol (rophies, roofies, rope)\\n\\nThis drug is in the same category of drugs as Valium, a benzodiazepine, but it is more potent than Valium. Initially, it causes a sense of relaxation and reduction of anxiety. At higher doses, light-headedness, dizziness, lack of coordination, and slurred speech occur. The drug affects memory and, in higher doses or if mixed with other drugs or alcohol, can result in amnesia for the time period the user is under the influence. Because of this amnesia effect, Rhohypnol has been given intentionally to others to facilitate sexual assault and other crimes. Combining this drug with other sedating drugs, including alcohol, will increase the intensity of all effects of the drug and, in sufficient doses, can cause respiratory arrest and death. Dependency can occur.\\n\\nHeroin and Other Opiates\\n\\nThese drugs are usually taken intravenously. “Designer” drugs similar to opiates include Fentanyl, Demerol, and “china white.” Addiction and dependence develop rapidly. Use is characterized by impaired judgment, slurred speech and drowsiness. Overdose is manifested by coma, shock, and depressed respiration, with the possibility of death from respiratory arrest. Withdrawal problems include sweating, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, irritability, nausea and vomiting, and muscle and joint pains.\\n\\nHallucinogens or Psychedelics\\n\\nThis group of drugs includes LSD, mescaline, peyote, and phencyclidine (PCP or “angel dust”). Use impairs and distorts one’s perception of surroundings, causes bizarre mood changes, and results in visual hallucinations that involve geometric forms, colors, and persons or objects. Users who discontinue use experience “flashbacks” consisting of distortions of virtually any sensation. Withdrawal may require psychiatric treatment for the accompanying persistent psychotic states. Suicide is not uncommon.\\n\\nSolvent Inhalants (glue, lacquers, plastic cement, etc.)\\n\\nFumes from these substances cause problems similar to alcohol. Incidents of hallucinations and permanent brain damage are more frequent with chronic use.\\n\\nMarijuana (cannabis)\\n\\nMarijuana may be ingested in a variety of ways, including but not limited to oral ingestion, smoking, and vaping. Marijuana causes disconnected ideas, alteration of depth perception and sense of time, impaired judgment, and impaired coordination. Prolonged use can lead to psychological dependence.\\n\\nIntravenous Drug Use\\n\\nIn addition to the adverse effects associated with the use of a specific drug, intravenous drug users who use unsterilized needles or who share needles with other drug users can develop HIV disease, hepatitis, tetanus (lockjaw), and infections in the heart. Permanent damage may also result.\\n\\nUTSA is a Drug-Free School\\n\\nThe Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 requires institutions of higher education to adopt and implement programs to prevent the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol. Information concerning these programs must be distributed to students annually. UTSA has adopted the following:\\n\\nStandards of Conduct\\n\\n\\nUniversity Sanctions\\n\\n\\nStudents\\n\\nThe University will impose at least a minimum disciplinary sanction of suspension for a specified period of time, or suspension of rights and privileges, or both, for conduct related to the use, possession, or distribution of drugs prohibited by state, federal, or local law. Other sanctions that may be imposed for conduct related to the unlawful use, possession, or distribution of drugs or alcohol include disciplinary probation, payment for damage to or misappropriation of property, suspension of rights and privileges, suspension for a specified period of time, expulsion, or other such sanction as may be deemed appropriate under the circumstances.\\n\\nEmployees\\n\\nThe unlawful use, possession, or distribution of drugs or alcohol will result in a penalty of disciplinary probation, demotion, suspension without pay, or termination, depending upon the circumstances.\\n\\nStudent Health Services\\n\\n\\nPenalties under State and Federal Law\\n\\n\\nI.

My goal is to help students reach their fullest potential academically and personally by connecting them with experiences outside the classroom and helping them stretch their comfort zones. This can take a lot of different formats, but generally involves advising and mentoring as well as program development. I also manage the day-to-day compliance and operations for the Top Scholar program. In Fall 2020, I am excited to teach Tutorial I: Justice.\\nI grew up in a small town in East Texas. We were a multi-generational household of all women (grandma, mom, and 3 sisters), never enough counter space in the bathroom, and a host of 4-legged furry family members. I went to college at Stephen F. Austin State University, where I majored in Political Science. After a brief stint in the U.S. Army which landed me in San Antonio, I entered graduate school at UTSA, where I earned an M.A. in Political Science. In spring, 2020, I celebrated 19 years at UTSA. My roles at UTSA have included program development, teaching, advising, admissions, and retention and graduation analysis. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my heart-throb hubby Walter and always amusing niece Amber, along with waogging (walk-jogging), listening to live music, and cozying up with a good book.\\n\\nCultural Exploration\\n\\nI love learning about other cultures and meeting new people. I take every opportunity to explore new places and food, whether that be in my own backyard or across the globe. The more unconventional and off the beaten path, the better. Hole-in-the-wall restaurants, mom-and-pop B&Bs, and historical places with local tour guides are my absolute favorite way to spend time away from the office. All along the way, my goal is to appreciate and understand our differences (and similarities) as humans living on earth.\\n\\nProfessional Development\\n\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nMy research is not the same as a traditional faculty member, but I enjoy policy studies, legislation analysis, college completion, and student development. I have published more than 15 articles and presented at numerous national and state conferences in Political Science, Academic Advising, and Student Development.\\nI love helping students explore new ways to meet and exceed their personal and professional goals using their strengths in creative ways. Whether it be traveling to a new country, landing an internship they never knew existed, or pursuing a prestigious award, the opportunities for Honors students are limitless.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

It lays strong foundations through academic enrichment, financial support, faculty and peer mentoring, and training in UTSA biomedical research laboratories. It will also guide the ESTEEMED Scholars into an elite extramural summer program, advanced upper division undergraduate research training at UTSA, and eventually a Ph.D. program in biomedical sciences.\\n\\nProgram Details\\n\\nESTEEMED Scholars begin their training in a five-week summer \"Bootcamp\" enrichment program in the summer prior to their first year. After this summer work, they are admitted to the UTSA Honors College and also engage in ESTEEMED-sponsored progressive year-round training and support until they are rising third year students. The summer program will start tentatively in the last third of June.\\nThe Scholars take part in pre-research training and then in meaningful year-round laboratory research. They also take part in peer and faculty mentoring and academic assistance programs, and develop strong foundations in computational biology and bioimaging topics.\\nIn the summer before their second year, the Scholars begin working in actual research labs at UTSA. As rising third year students, they enter a summer research training program at one of the top research institutes in the country.\\nESTEEMED Scholars who develop strong academic and research credentials are given priority consideration for entry into the Junior/Senior-level UTSA MARC program, as well as other funded training opportunities at UTSA. Trainees in MARC and other student research programs at UTSA have very strong placement records into some of the top biomedical research programs in the country.\\n\\nFinancial Considerations\\n\\n- During their first year summer bootcamp, Scholars receive support to partially fund their housing.\\n- During the fall and spring semesters, students receive $6000 per semester ($12,000 per year).\\n- In their second year, Scholars receive $500 towards attendance to a national student research conference.\\n- Trainees will participate in research in their next two summers, either at UTSA or an extramural program. Funding of up to $4000 is provided, and up to $1000 for travel, if they are not funded by an extramural program.\\nMentoring\\n\\nStay Connected to the Klesse College of Engineering and Integrated Design\\n\\n\\nUTSA Mission\\n\\nThe University of Texas at San Antonio is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge through research and discovery, teaching and learning, community engagement and public service.

Our students work with organizations such as the United Nations Information Centre, the US Department of State, many offices within the White House and on the Hill, with federal agencies, and with non-profit organizations.

While in Washington, D.C., students earn in-residence UT San Antonio credit for their coursework and gain hands-on work experience in an internship. By living together in luxury condominiums near Capitol Hill, Archer Fellows build lasting friendships and professional connections with each other. The Archer Fellowship Program can be tailored to students’ own personal and intellectual interests.\\n\\nEmily Seddighzadeh '24\\n\\nWith passions that lie at the intersection of environmental issues, law, and social justice, the Archer Fellowship Program was a perfect fit for Emily Seddighzadeh â\\x80\\x9924.

UTSA is different. In our college, you can complete your requirements through Honors Courses or through Honors Experiences completed outside of the classroom.\\n\\nWhat’s better, Honors Courses or Experiences Outside of the Classroom?\\n\\nThat is a personal preference, but most students do a combination of both.\\nRequirements\\nExperiences\\nExperiential Learning Fair\\nThe advantage of doing experiences outside of the classroom is that they truly show who you are and what you can do. Generally, these experiences build your resume better than courses and in such a way that you are significantly more competitive on the job market, for graduate schools, and for other awards (even undergraduate scholarships if you start early). If chosen carefully, experiences will give you a resume that positions you to be nationally competitive for the openings most interesting to you. One of the key things that experiences showcase to a potential employer or graduate school committee is your initiative and drive. People reviewing your resume clearly see that you are willing to seek out and take advantages of significant, life-changing opportunities. The kinds of experiences that you complete define who you are, demonstrate what you know, and underscore your ability to grow, develop, and deliver beyond the classroom!\\n\\nHow does one find Honors Courses?\\n\\n\\nWhat Constitutes an Experience Outside of the Classroom?\\n\\nStudents can design their own experience or take part in existing programs as long as they meet the following criteria:\\n- They require 75 hours minimum time on task\\n- They result in a significant achievement, one generally worth placing on a resume or discussed in a job interview\\n- They have a guided mentor\\nUTSA offers many opportunities that meet the requirements above. For example, students who play in Spirit of San Antonio can get credit for an experience. Other examples include things like ensembles, intercollegiate and club athletics, research labs/programs, and independent studies with professors. Other experiences will take place off-campus, such as internships at companies, summer research experiences via the National Science Foundation at other universities, or study abroad programs. We advertise many of these directly to Honors students, but many of our students will research or create their own opportunities, like writing a screenplay or self-publishing a children’s book.\\nUnlike classes that have a registration period, deadlines to apply for experiences fall at various time throughout the year and information regarding them is generally located in disparate locations. You can find them at internship fairs, your college’s student success center, the study abroad fair, the internet… they are all over.\\nHonors also creates guided experiences. These are non-credit bearing experiences that we organize and do as a group. Examples in the past have included teaching English as a second language, forming a student-led task force to make suggestions on university policies regarding COVID-19, and collecting oral histories from community housing residents in San Antonio.\\n\\nHow do you know I have completed an Honors course or experience?\\n\\nCourses are easy: they are on your transcript. Degree Works will pick those up when completed. Honors contracts also get recorded as Honors courses on the transcript once you have completed the final paperwork.\\n\\nWhat are some myths about Honors courses?\\n\\nStudents worry that Honors courses are harder or more competitive. Nothing can be further from the truth. They are just different. Many students find them easier because they are smaller, students receive personalized attention, and they have great study partners/group members. Generally, they are also community creators and really fun.\\n\\nWhat are some myths about experiences?\\n\\n\\nFinal Takeaways: Make intentional choices; take chances; ask us for help\\n\\n\\nOpportunities within the Honors College\\n\\nThe Honors College offers students the opportunity to participate in a number of different programs to further expand knowledge, especially in the realms of professional development, leadership development, and public service. Special programs are fully integrated into the Honors College curriculum, making credit transfer simple and ensuring that students are working toward Honors requirements.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top\\n\\n'),\n",

Some professional fields; such as doctors and attorneys, are required to have additional hours of \"continuing education\" beyond their degree to ensure they have the most up-to-date knowledge required to practice medicine or law. Professional Development experiences are intended to begin working on those skills while you are an undergraduate student in order to add to the knowledge base that is your chosen degree.\\nRequirements\\nExperiences\\nExperiential Learning Fair\\nWhile you are an undergraduate student, you have the opportunity to begin adding those skills that will make you a more knowledgeable and competitive job or graduate school applicant. Every year, thousands of students will graduate and share your chosen career or graduate school interests. Professional Development shows prospective employers and admissions committees that you are committed not only to performing well but becoming a leader and will set you apart from other applicants. Additionally, through internships, Professional Development can put you into the workplace of someone who is doing what you want to do!\\nNo – whether you are majoring in art, engineering, kinesiology, or business – Professional Development is an important part of adding to the foundation that is going to be your college degree. While professional development experiences may take very different forms, they all have the same goal of adding skills and competencies to your education.\\n- Interned for members of Congress, shadowed doctors, and worked in non-profit organizations\\n- Learned computer coding languages not required by their degree\\n- Obtained professional licenses associated with their degree and field of study\\n- Attended professional programs related to their career (Summer Law Prep Academy)\\nSome majors will issue students credit for an internship, but they may also want you to do it in a specific course year like in your junior or senior year. The Honors College can also issue credit for internship experiences, but we do not have these same requirements. In fact, some students do entry-level internships in their first year, which helps them receive internship offers at prominent organizations in their junior or senior year.\\nApplying credit for Professional Development to satisfy Honors SPICES requires a minimum of 75+ hours of time on task while supervised/mentored, a stated goal to be reached by the end of the project, and submission of an experience approval form. For more information on Honors College Experience requirements, visit the Experience Approval Process page.\\nBefore looking for a Professional Development experience, ask yourself, “Where do I want to be in 10 years?” Your Professional Development experience should be approached as a stepping-stone to where you are and where you want your professional career to take you! Talk to your faculty or professionals in the field; once you have some basic-skills via your courses or lab work, reach out to the Career Center and they can assist you as well. Finally, don’t discount reaching out via email or by phone to a “dream company” or organization!\\nA successful Professional Development experience should be a path that sets you apart from your peers in your chosen major. Whether through the networking and skills built while interning with a business, government agency, or non-profit; or through developing new skills and expanding your knowledge base, a successful Professional Development experience should be viewed as a way to expand and deepen the knowledge you are gaining through regular coursework.\\nAndrew Hernandez, Texas Real Estate License\\n\\nFind Professional Development Opportunities\\n\\n\\nOpportunities within the Honors College\\n\\nThe Honors College offers students the opportunity to participate in a number of different programs to further expand knowledge, especially in the realms of professional development, leadership development, and public service.

Intellectual Achievement is when you become not just a consumer of intellectual work, but a producer. Intellectual Achievement as an experience is when you take the concepts and ideas that you have learned and then use them to produce something new. This could be research in a biology lab, doing social science research, or doing humanities research on art or literature. These same skills of producing something new also occur in creative ventures when students develop a novel business plan, write a fiction novel, or compose music. Intellectual Achievement is the point at which you can show that you can take what is known and produce something new.\\nRequirements\\nExperiences\\nExperiential Learning Fair\\nStudents who are planning to pursue a Master’s, Doctorate, or other degree beyond the Bachelor’s degree start to demonstrate that they can create something new, whether that is producing new scholarship in their field of study or coming up with a solution to solve a problem. Many students will apply to graduate schools with excellent grade point averages but far fewer will have the ability to show that they are prepared to produce original work. And many graduate programs require a writing sample.\\nFor students who wish to join the workforce, businesses and non-profits are looking for people who are innovative and can solve problems. Whether it’s a logistical problem with supply-chains, a distinctive expression of artistic style, or any one of the ever emerging cyber-security threats, employers want to know that you have the ability to provide new solutions to problems where others haven’t been successful..\\nAll of the technological progress we have achieved, the artistic styles we enjoy, and the improvement on what we have is the result of intellectual achievement. The basic principles and concepts found in your courses – be it mechanical engineering, political science, biomedical engineering, or anthropology – can serve as the foundation for an intellectual achievement experience!\\n- Spent a semester or year in a research lab\\n- Served as a research assistant to a faculty member\\n- Attended a Research Experience for Undergraduates Program\\n- Composed and produced a music album\\n- Published an article in UTSA Undergraduate Journal\\n- Wrote an undergraduate Honors thesis\\nInspiration and ideas can come from numerous places: many of your faculty are conducting research in their field and can provide some guidance based on your interests. As an R1 research institution, faculty are conducting cutting edge research, and students often play a large role in their projects.\\nMany disciplines have problems looking for a solution, things can be improved upon, or a reinterpretation of established ideas. If you have an interest with a particular area within your discipline, start looking at how UTSA faculty are approaching problems.\\nAt the conclusion of an Intellectual Achievement experience, you should have something to point to that you produced. This may come in the form of an Honors Thesis, research you’ve conducted on your own or as part of a larger study – something original that you can put your name on and claim it as your own. Again, this will look different from one discipline to another, but a successful Intellectual Achievement experience should embody the idea of \"intellectual producer.\"\\n\\nFind Intellectual Achievement Opportunities\\n\\n\\nOpportunities within the Honors College\\n\\nThe Honors College offers students the opportunity to participate in a number of different programs to further expand knowledge, especially in the realms of professional development, leadership development, and public service.

Cultural exploration includes:\\n- Language immersion and study in a foreign country.\\n- Work immersion in a foreign country.\\n- Service Learning in a foreign country.\\n- Fieldwork in your discipline in a foreign country or a location/community in the United States notably different than San Antonio and your hometown.\\n- Cultural immersion programs in a foreign country or a location/community in the United States notably different than San Antonio and your hometown.\\n- Projects or activities that engage with art, culinary art, or music traditions of a foreign country or a location/community in the United States notably different than San Antonio and your hometown.\\nRequirements\\nExperiences\\nExperiential Learning Fair\\n\\nWhy Should I Choose Cultural Exploration?\\n\\nPursuing an Honors Experience in Cultural Exploration is an opportunity for you to learn about another culture, interact with people from that culture, and develop intercultural competency. Intercultural competence is the ability to work effectively across cultures and is a valuable asset to have as a graduating student. In an increasingly globalizing world, it is more likely that you will be working in teams with people from backgrounds different from your own, collaborating across borders, or being required to travel for work. Students pursuing Cultural Exploration as an Honors experience come away with greater resilience, adaptability, and ability to communicate with others effectively.\\n\\nIs Cultural Exploration Limited to Certain Majors or Disciplines?\\n\\nNo – whether you are majoring in foreign languages to become a diplomat or are an aspiring computer scientist, Cultural Exploration will be a valuable Honors Experience, as you will learn how to interact with people across cultures. Some majors will have cultural exploration programs like study abroad built into the degree plan, whereas other majors, particularly the sciences and engineering, might see students completing cultural exploration experiences over the summer.\\n\\nWhat Have Other Students Done for Cultural Exploration?\\n\\n- The most common example is study abroad, Internships abroad, and Service learning abroad.\\n- Designing an oral history project with a diaspora group in San Antonio.\\n- Online courses offered by a foreign university.\\n- Virtual internships offered through foreign companies or study abroad providers.\\n\\nHow Do I Get Credit for Cultural Exploration?\\n\\n\\nHow Do I Find Cultural Exploration Experiences?\\n\\n- Honors College Study Abroad Programs. We routinely offer three programs to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Japan.\\n\\nHow do I fund study abroad?\\n\\nThere are tons of scholarship opportunities for study abroad, and many allow for students to apply for funding up to a year in advance, before they have committed to or paid for their program:\\n\\nExample ELF Posters and Presentations in Cultural Exploration\\n\\n\\nOpportunities within the Honors College\\n\\nThe Honors College offers students the opportunity to participate in a number of different programs to further expand knowledge, especially in the realms of professional development, leadership development, and public service.

Through the mentorship of a faculty committee, an undergraduate student will complete a research or creative project and is designed to add to the body of knowledge in their given major or minor. Keep in mind that theses can take a variety of forms – from conducting laboratory research or building an engineering project to arranging a portfolio of original music or writing a novel.\\nRequirements\\nExperiences\\nExperiential Learning Fair\\n\\nYes, you can!\\n\\nThe idea of working on an Honors thesis can seem overwhelming to many students. You, however, have resources and support systems which include: faculty, academic counselors, and sometimes money to see your thesis project through to completion. Most importantly, you have your undergraduate career to build upon – the skills you’ve developed, the theoretical and applied lessons learned, and the relationships you have built. You are your greatest asset!\\n\\nDo I have to enroll in a class?\\n\\nWhile enrolling in the HON 4993 course to write a thesis proposal or complete research and writing of a thesis is the most common approach (and recommended), students may elect to work on a thesis project without enrolling in a thesis course. While satisfying the hours require for your degree should remain your first priority, completing the thesis stands alone as a benefit itself. Should you find yourself concerned about going beyond the 150 credit-hour ceiling, you may elect to conduct a thesis project without enrolling in the course. Keep in mind that, unlike traditional classes, you will meet with your thesis committee at times and for durations of your choosing. Should you choose to do a departmental rather than an Honors thesis (e.g., BIO 4993 v. HON 4993), be sure to let your Counselor know so we can ensure you receive credit – the sooner the better!\\n\\nAre you ready?

I also coordinate and host various events for currently enrolled Honors College students. Because of my job duties, I have the privilege of collaborating with various departments across campus and have a very wide and diverse network. I often connect students with colleagues that will help them achieve their academic and professional goals.\\nI completed both my Bachelor of Arts degree in Communication, Advertising and Public Relations and my Master of Education degree in Student Development and Leadership in Higher Education at Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas. When I began my undergraduate degree, my dream was to become a public relations specialist in professional sports. When I began my Master of Arts in Communication, I learned about working in higher education. After my first semester, I switch my area of study from communication to education.\\nI have been with UTSA since June 2012 working in various departments including serving as: the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of the Student Center for Community Engagement and Inclusion including Volunteer Services and the Dreamers Resource Center, Interim Associate Dean of Students and Director of the Student Leadership Center and Student Center for Community Engagement and Inclusion, Associate Director of Student Activities for Student Organizations and Programming at UTSA, and Assistant Director of Undergraduate Admissions for Communications and Special Projects.\\nPrior to joining UTSA, I worked as a Non-Traditional Admissions Counselor/Advisor for Concordia University Texas San Antonio Center, Senior Admission Counselor at Schreiner University, Special Projects and Events Coordinator for the Angelo State University Alumni Association, and Graduate Assistant for the Angelo State University Center for Academic Advising.\\nLydia is married to Nathan “Nate” Bueno who is an elementary school special education teacher in Northside ISD. They have one dog named Ranger.\\n\\nService\\n\\nBecause of my many years working in higher education, I often informally provide advice and assistance to family and friends and sometimes even strangers on higher education admissions processes and financial aid opportunities. I have also volunteered to serve on various professional committees including serving as the UTSA representative for Social Belonging for the UT System Pillars of Student Success system-wide committee.\\n\\nIntellectual Achievement\\n\\nClearly, I have a passion for working in higher education. My interests include social and cultural influences on learning and academic and social belonging. Because of these interests, I often share my knowledge with others who are working to improve events and teaching around culture and policies, and procedures that promote belonging.\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nI would like to eventually continue my education and earn a doctorate in a degree that would allow me to teach higher education administration. I feel too many education programs focus on K-12 educators and not higher education. My research will focus on social and cultural influences on learning.\\nI really love seeing our students develop their own identities throughout their time at UTSA. I also very much enjoy working with various campus colleagues to serve the Honors College community. I am given so many opportunities to collaborate with a number of different departments to learn about their services and then connect them to our students.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

My parents were both artists but I loved science and went to Harvard to study physics, planning to teach at the college level. I switched my area of study to forestry and then molecular genetics but stayed focused on becoming a teacher. After graduating, I worked as a tissue culture technician for 2 years at the MIT Center for Cancer Research and then went to the University of California, San Diego for my Ph.D. in Biology. I started a postdoc at the University of California, San Francisco but moved back to UCSD after a year, in part so I could marry my wife, Mary McNaughton-Cassill. Our twin daughters, Carolyn and Julia, were born in San Diego. We all moved to San Antonio in 1994 so I could start in the Biology Department at UTSA. My wife joined the Psychology faculty in 1998. We are the only married couple in Texas who have both won the UT Regents’ Outstanding Teacher Award and the Piper Professorship. Back in the day when Honors College students voted for their commencement speaker, we were selected to give 10 of 32 of the talks.

Moving around the US has taught me the most about embracing change and being adaptable. In college, I started out as an overly ambitious pre-med student, majoring in Biology. Having completed my pre-med requirements in biology and chemistry, I decided to explore languages and literature. After studying abroad in Russia, I decided to leave behind a career in the health profession. I switched my major to Russian Language and after graduation, took the Trans-Siberian Railway to Eastern Russia, where I volunteered with an ecotourism and education non-profit organization. Returning to the US, I attended graduate school and received a Ph.D. in Russian Literature and Culture from the University of Pittsburgh. Before coming to the UTSA, I directed the Office of Study Abroad at St. Mary’s University and taught Russian language and literature at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and the College of William and Mary in Virginia.\\n\\nIntellectual Achievement\\n\\nI publish on topics in Russian literature, culture, and new media. I also serve as the lead editor of the academic journal Digital Icons: Studies in Russian, Eurasian, and Central European New Media, which features professors, graduate students, and nonacademics from all over the world writing about the impact of the internet and digital technology on politics, economics, society, culture and the arts in Russia, Eurasia, and Central Europe.\\n\\nEngaged Living\\n\\nIn college, I was a student-athlete on my university's Squash team, which meant dedicating a significant portion of my student life to training, proper nutrition, and time management to allow for weekly tournaments in which we traveled across the East Coast. Since college, I've adopted new hobbies of backpacking, trekking, and bikepacking, which involve multi-day self-supported trips across trails, either by foot or bike. These trips allow me to escape work and disconnect for a bit, but also understand my place in the natural world and personally examine my impact on the environment. On each trip, we follow principles to leave no trace, pack in/pack out everything we bring, and appreciate and respect our surroundings. Past trips of mine include hiking the distance of the GR20 trail in Corsica (120 miles in 18 days), hiking across portions of the Appalachian Trail in Virginia and Maine, and biking from Pittsburgh to Washington D.C. (309 miles in 5 days).\\nMy favorite thing about working in the Honors College is working with students to research opportunities, be open to new possibilities, and build up the courage and resilience to apply for them.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top\"),\n",

I taught Global Studies at Flowing Wells High School in Tucson, Arizona after graduation but always dreamed of going to graduate school. I moved from Tucson and attended the University of Connecticut in Storrs where I received my M.A. in history in 2002. I focused on early American history and the French and Indian War. After finishing that degree, I applied for the Ph.D. program in Curriculum and Instruction in the Neag School of Education at UConn and finished in 2007. My first faculty position was at the University of Rochester where I was an assistant professor in Social Studies Education in 2007 and joined UTSA in 2009 as an assistant professor in the Social Foundations in the College of Education and Human Development. I was excited to be part of the growth that UTSA was soon to undertake along with the position itself. The social foundations encompass what I call the “humanities wing of schools of education”, studying the historical, theoretical, social, anthropological, sociological, and economic foundations of education and schooling. My work dances across the humanities and education, focusing on cultural studies, the archive, critical social theories, imagination, and critical pedagogy. I am looking forward to working with our UTSA Honor’s College students and sharing my research experience in the archives as we explore engaging and provocative topics together as a critical learning community.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

There were many obstacles I had to face and challenges I had to overcome. Along the way, I worked as a store cashier, dishwasher, assistant cook, cafeteria supervisor, summer camp chaperone, computer lab print operator, pharmacy assistant, research lab assistant, teaching assistant, math and science tutor, teacher in a local school district, etc. Guess what? It was all a part of my learning experience! I am a lifelong learner and will be your friendly guide to the world of data science, empowering you to explore the endless possibilities it offers. I strive to be more than just an instructor. Appreciating a spectrum of diverse viewpoints (both Western and Eastern), I am dedicated to creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment. I hope to continue learning and growing, fostering my love for education in every student. Fun fact about me? I am an origami enthusiast, a taekwondo (Korean martial art) student, and a karaoke lover (not a good singer though HAHA).\\nMy main research interests include statistical modeling, data science and analytics, operations research in the areas of reliability, survival analysis, lifetime and degradation analyses, predictive maintenance planning with applications to healthcare, biomedicine, chemometrics, cybersecurity, renewable energy, industrial engineering and beyond. My work has appeared in numerous peer-reviewed journals such as IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, Naval Research Logistics, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, Chemometrics & Intelligent Laboratory Systems, Quality Engineering, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, Journal of Statistical Planning & Inference, Communications in Statistics, PLoS ONE, and others. Below is a list of my selected publications.\\nRecognized for the teaching and research excellence, I have received the University of Texas System Regents’ Outstanding Teaching Award (the highest teaching award in the University of Texas System), the UTSA President’s Distinguished Achievement Award for Teaching Excellence, the UTSA Distinguished Teaching Professorship, the Carlos Alvarez College of Business Faculty Leadership Fellowship, the Carlos Alvarez College of Business Faculty Teaching Excellence Award and the Carlos Alvarez College of Business Dean’s Research Excellence Award.

I have explored many hundreds of miles through wild spaces with curiosity and reverence, traveling by trail, river canyon, and ridgeline. My travels have taken me throughout the Americas, Europe, and Africa, climbing big walls, desert towers, and alpine spires; kayaking remote rivers, waterfalls, and ocean swells; walking, cycling, and hitchhiking dirt roads.\\n\\nService\\n\\nMy professional focus is on student leadership development through cooperative group experience with a sense of adventure – helping students envision and enact change with renewed compassion, excitement, and an expanded sense of possibility. My team and I within Leadership and Volunteer Services support students to lead with confidence, serve with integrity, and inspire others to make a positive impact. My perspectives on student leadership development emerged from a background in experiential education, informed by David Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory. I also very much appreciate and incorporate the framework of the Social Change Model developed by Helen and Alexander Astin, which empowers emerging leaders to facilitate positive social change in their communities.\\nSome of my favorite work for the past decade has been developing curriculum and co-leading UTSA’s five-day Civil Rights and Social Justice Experience, which journeys by bus on the very roads traveled by the Freedom Riders to landmarks of the civil rights movement in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and explores positive change-making through the stories of the leaders involved.

Through these discoveries, I also get to witness the amazing ways these students positively impact their communities and society.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

I want to help students embrace the honors experiential learning curriculum and strive to discover new ways to turn their ideas and passions into lifelong careers.\\nI was born and raised in the small town of Vacaville, California. I received my B.A. in Sociology and Anthropology in 2020 from Southern Oregon University and my M.A. in Postsecondary Educational Leadership in 2023 from San Diego State University. My professional experience has centered around higher education and student affairs for the past five years, and I have worked in various institutions across California and Oregon. My passions include student success, retention, leadership, career development, and service learning.\\nIn my free time, I love to go to the theater, travel, discover new restaurants for my food blog, and hang out with my friends and family. I also enjoy anime, all things disney, finding new recipes to cook, and teaching dance classes to students of all ages in tap, jazz, musical theater, and hip-hop styles.\\nTo embrace and challenge your perspectives of the world and gain an appreciation for other cultures, traveling is the best way to immerse yourself in exploring cultural differences. The world is full of different languages, cultures, phenomena, beliefs, etc., and exploring different parts of the world can help us grow in our cultural awareness, communication, and values. My goal is to help students find deeper meaning in their traveling experience and better understand how it relates to their professional development goals and field of study. Having traveled abroad several times, I encourage all students to take advantage of institutions' traveling resources. I am excited to help students apply, research, and prepare for their study abroad experiences within the UTSA Honors College.\\nHaving received my Master's degree in educational leadership, I am passionate about teaching different leadership theories, techniques, and skills. Last year, I instructed a first-year leadership seminar class on the fundamentals of leadership and furthering students' development of their personal leadership competencies. Teaching this course sparked my passion for teaching, and I plan to continue furthering my knowledge of leadership foundations while teaching students how to put these skills toward their professional and personal growth.\\nRegarding research, I am interested in delving into the power of affinity groups in creating a strong sense of community on college campuses. I want to eventually conduct more research on how creating a culture through affinity groups can lead to positive outcomes for student success and retention and foster a sense of belonging through diverse familiar spaces. I hope to collaborate with students across UTSA to research the deeper purpose of affinity groups and how students utilize them to create supportive and inclusive safe spaces for learning.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top\"),\n",

Over the past five years, I have taught classes on a wide variety of topics, from women’s leadership to design thinking to the anthropology of food. Regardless of the topic, my aim is to encourage students to think differently about the world around them.\\nI have a BA in Economics and an MA in Social Sciences, both from the University of Chicago. Like many econ majors, I planned to go to graduate school in economics. The only problem was that I was more interested in the political life of economic ideas (how they are used in policymaking) than I was in the ideas themselves, so instead, I enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Anthropology at the University of Chicago, where I conducted dissertation research on how economic ideas are used in the policymaking process in Mexico. For my dissertation research, I spent one year in Mexico City, working alongside government officials, many of whom had PhDs in economics, to understand how economic ideas are woven into policy.\\nAfter completing my Ph.D., I was a Collegiate Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago, where I taught courses on social theory, political theory, and political anthropology. A family move brought me to San Antonio in 2007, and after commuting to Chicago for two years, I accepted a job as a qualitative researcher at USAA, a Fortune 200 financial services company. In that role, I had an opportunity to apply my research skills to the private sector to help identify new opportunities to serve USAA’s members.\\nIn 2014, I co-founded RedSquared Consulting with Jenia Espe with a simple mission: to inspire businesses tom become more human through customer understanding and empathy. Since its founding, we have helped over 25 companies and non-profits across the country use customer research to understand their customers’ needs and develop compelling customer journeys. In 2020, RedSquared Consulting was awarded a CivTech Fellowship with the City of San Antonio to develop the OneCity app for San Antonio residents.\\nI am passionate about women’s leadership and recently completed a book manuscript titled, Set Up: Why Women Lean Back and What We Can Do About It. The book identifies outdated assumptions about work and productivity that continue to fuel ongoing career and pay disparities between men and women and what we can do to change them.\\nWhat I love most about the Honors College at UTSA is the spirit of innovation. Everyone, from the students to the faculty to the administration, is constantly looking forward and thinking about how to do things better, which makes it an exciting place at which to teach and learn.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

My work is policy- and solution-oriented, highly interdisciplinary, and has been published in top peer-reviewed journals.\\nDuring my academic career, I have designed and taught a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses in immigration and labor force, development and public policy in Latin America, statistics, demographic theory and methods, and research methodology. Drawing on my research interests and involvement in the local community, I have provided students with the knowledge and first-hand experience of globalization, migration, trade, development, poverty, and inequality. For example, in one of my UTSA Honors College courses on Global Commerce and Human Mobility, students understand and experience how globalization and neoliberalism impact cross-border mobility between Texas and Mexico. The course offers an introduction to these subjects and a meaningful interaction with guest speakers and institutions in San Antonio highly involved in the U.S.-Mexico connection. An additional study abroad program in Mexico provides the opportunity to interact with policymakers and other stakeholders on the other side of the border. The effort to connect this course with the local community has also provided opportunities for students to foster relationships with Non-Profit Organizations like Catholic Charities San Antonio.\\nI was Vice Provost for International Initiatives at UTSA and concurrently the Executive Director of ConTex, a joint initiative of the University of Texas System and Mexico’s National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT). I served as Under Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior in Mexico. In this role, I oversaw all policies, programs, and activities related to population, migration, and religious affairs. Other academic positions include Executive Director for the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies (USMEX) at the University of California, San Diego, and Provost at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte. I have received several professional honors, including President of the Mexican Society of Demography (SOMEDE) and membership in the National Academy of Science of Mexico.\\nI was born and raised in México. I have lived in five cities in Mexico (Mazatlán, México City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Tijuana) and four in the United States (Austin, San Diego, Philadelphia, and San Antonio). I received my Ph.D. from UT Austin, where I also met and married my wife, Elseke. In 2013, after many years of living and working in two different countries, my family and I decided to move to San Antonio when UTSA offered me a professorship position. We have three incredible children, Mariana, Alfonso, and Dalex, and two amazing dogs, Lola and Charlie.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- UTSA Honors College | GSR 2.210\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nFuture Students\\n\\n\\nCurrent Students\\n\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBack to Top'),\n",

Certificate programs are narrower in scope and shorter in duration than master’s degrees. Certificate programs are not “degree” programs.\\n\\nAdmission Requirements\\n\\nApplicants who are currently enrolled in a graduate degree program at UTSA have already met University requirements for admission. In this case, no formal application process is necessary. The applicant should contact the Certificate Program Advisor and complete a form requesting permission to enter and complete the certificate program. If the request is approved, this form will be signed by the Certificate Program Advisor and the Dean of the College or Director of the Center in which the certificate program is housed. A copy of this form will be sent to the Graduate Advisor of Record for the student’s degree program, the department in which the applicant’s program is housed, and the Graduate School.\\nApplicants who are not currently enrolled in a graduate degree program at UTSA will be required to apply for admission to UTSA as a special (non-degree-seeking) graduate student and indicate their intent to seek admission into a certificate program. Applicants will be required to meet University admission requirements for special graduate students.\\nIf it is determined by the Certificate Program Advisor that an applicant requires prerequisite background courses to adequately prepare for the courses included in the certificate program, this will be noted in the applicant’s file. The applicant will be notified that the prerequisite courses must be taken before enrolling in certificate program coursework.\\nAny applicant who is admitted into a certificate program without being currently enrolled in a graduate degree program is considered to be a special graduate student. If the applicant wishes to be admitted into a degree program, they will be required to apply to that program as a degree-seeking student. Admittance into or completion of a certificate program is not considered to be qualification for entry into a graduate degree program.\\nApplicants who are pursuing a certificate as a special graduate \\xadstudent will not be eligible for financial aid.\\nApplicants who are admitted into a certificate program while also pursuing a graduate degree will be classified as degree-seeking students. Undergraduate students may not enroll in graduate certificate programs.\\n\\nTransfer of Credit\\n\\nStudents are expected to complete the majority of all coursework at UTSA. UTSA awards credit for college-level transfer coursework of no more than 3 semester credit hours, earned with a grade of “B” or higher, from accredited colleges and universities. Admitted students may submit a petition for credits to the related Graduate Program Committee and academic College to receive credit earned from foreign institutions and non-accredited colleges or universities. Based on course level, rigor, quality, comparability, and degree program relevance, credits may be awarded on an individual basis at the discretion of the Graduate Program Committee, academic College and the Graduate School.\\nUTSA reserves the right to refuse recognition of credit from a college or university if it is determined the course does not meet the department’s standards of level, rigor, quality, comparability, and degree program relevance. Applicability of such coursework toward the UTSA degree plan is at the discretion of the major academic department. Work counted toward a degree at another institution cannot be transferred.\\nConditions for transfer of credit:\\n- Students must complete the form “Transfer of Graduate Credit towards Master’s Degree.”\\n- Student must be in a current master’s degree or graduate certificate program.\\n- Student must be in good academic standing.\\n- The courses must have been completed with a grade of “B” (3.0) or better.\\n- Coursework cannot be used in another degree program.\\n- An official transcript from the institution where the coursework was completed must be submitted.\\n- All coursework must have been completed no more than six years before the degree was awarded.\\n- Coursework is subject to approval of the appropriate Graduate Program Committee and academic College in which the program is administered.\\n- Courses must be defined as graduate-level work at the institution where the credit was earned.\\n- International transcripts must be evaluated by a UTSA approved foreign credential evaluation service agency.\\n\\nCompletion of Requirements for a Certificate\\n\\nCompletion of a certificate program, with or without completion of a degree program, will be recorded on the student’s transcript if the following conditions are met:\\n- The student’s Certificate Program Advisor has prepared a Certificate Degree Plan, which will be sent to the Office of the Registrar prior to the end of the semester in which the student completes the requirements of the certificate.\\nIt is the responsibility of the student to meet with the Certificate Program Advisor during the last semester of certificate coursework in order to determine that all requirements of completion have been met. It is also the responsibility of the student to apply for the certificate by the established deadline by submitting a paper application to the Office of the Registrar, as explained above.\\nIf a student has graduated from one of UTSA’s approved graduate degree programs and then wishes to apply for a certificate using hours previously earned, the student must apply for admission to UTSA as a special (non-degree-seeking) graduate student and indicate their intent to seek admission into a certificate program.

She is currently the Vice President for Administrative Services and Chief Operating Officer at Pacific Lutheran University.\\n\\nShalita Myrick\\n\\n\\nM.S. in Facility Management\\n\\n\\nUTSA Online Class of 2022\\n\\nNot everyone knows exactly what career they want to pursue when they start college. And sometimes, even those who have career goals later realize they have a different dream. That’s what happened to Shalita Myrick early in her journey.\\nBefore she found her calling in facility management, Shalita had plans to become a lawyer. But as she graduated with a B.A. in Political Science, she realized it wasn’t the right path for her. Although she moved to Los Angeles with politics in mind, she worked in tech sales for a few years before discovering what would become her career.\\n“My old boss used to say ‘nobody dreams of becoming a facilities manager, it’s just something you stumble into,’” said Shalita. “I laugh at that because I did stumble into it, but I liked it so much I decided to pursue it academically and to really support my career in it.”\\nAs a project manager for facilities infrastructure, Shalita sees how her work helps people every day. That’s her passion. That’s why she goes to work every day.\\n“Service has always been important,” commented Shalita. “I think it really all comes from a personal and family background, rooted in struggle, but primarily in love. You know, we had a very giving and supportive community who saw a family in need and did not let us fail.”\\nAs a project manager at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), Shalita and her supervisor began discussing her future, with talks centered around her personal development as well as how she could achieve her career goals. But Shalita wasn’t looking for just any school. She needed one that fit her busy schedule.\\n“When I interviewed at UTSW, I was very open that my goal was to take her job when she was done, so my boss knew that that my goal was to be the director of Facilities Management and Building Services,” shared Shalita. “We both knew that whether I was on the academic or healthcare side, there were things that I needed to do and one was going back to school.”\\n“I knew that I was looking for education in my field, and I wasn’t sure what format that would take,” said Shalita. “When I saw that this program was online and therefore flexible, and I could do my work whether I wake up at four o’clock in the morning or wait until late in the evening, I knew it was for me.”\\nTo this day, Shalita is grateful for the email Dave sent out about the program. She’s thankful he recruited her and mentored her. She knows that UTSA Online was the right fit for her and her busy lifestyle.\\n“I feel like it found me,” added Shalita. “It really was the right choice for my life and my lifestyle. And it furthered my knowledge in what I already do and helped me be even more clear about what it is that I want for my career. So my conversations [with my bosses] are still the same. Someday I’m going to take your job. But now I know why and what’s expected of me to get there.”\\nShalita was right. The program prepared her for the next step in her career. In April 2023, she accepted a position as Principal Project Manager at MD Anderson Cancer Center. She has a new boss and new goals. But after studying at UTSA Online, she knows she’s ready to continue working towards her Bold Future.\\n\\nInterested in UTSA Online?\\n\\n\\nCategories\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles'),\n",

Through the Honors College at UTSA, I was able to apply to Fulbright as an English teaching assistant in Mexico. Currently, I am an English teaching assistant at a university here. Going to UTSA has helped me out in very different ways from navigating teacher-student interactions to creating lessons and activities with my students. Since I majored in Spanish I have always thought of possibly one day becoming a teacher so there are things I learned from the teachers who instructed me from how they planned out their classrooms to how they taught their classes and now it has helped me in being a teacher. As a teaching assistant, I help teachers work on lesson plans, and even teach a few classes. I have worked with topics from English literature, grammar, and syntax, and even instructed in classes that focus on becoming a teacher and what that entails.\\n\\nMateja, Senior Security and Operations Analyst at Accenture\\n\\n\\nModern Languages and Literatures Degree Programs\\n\\n\\nStudent Resources\\n\\n\\nStudy Abroad\\n\\n\\nHave an inquiry about our program?\\n\\nWe appreciate your interest in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures and extend our warmest welcome to you from the Department.\\n\\nLatest News\\n\\nAugust 16, 2024\\nPublished by Somb\\nMalgorzata Oleszkiewicz-Peralba has spent four decades finding the unifying thread of the human spirit among cultures across the globe.\\nJuly 11, 2024\\nPublished by UTSA Today\\nWorking to help students develop their language skills while preserving the cultural and linguistic traditions of Spanish-speaking communities in San Antonio, the faculty behind UTSAâ\\x80\\x99s Spanish as Heritage Language (SHL) program has been making some changes including offering new courses this fall.\\nMay 15, 2024\\nUTSA Today highlights the wide variety of study abroad opportunities at the university and within COLFA, including over 20 university-led programs that are taught by dedicated faculty and staff who have the expertise to offer unique academic experiences abroad.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nStay Connected to the College of Liberal and Fine Arts\\n\\n\\nVision\\n\\nUTSA's College of Liberal and Fine Arts will become an internationally recognized college providing the core intellectual experience that prepares students for their role as responsible citizens in a free society.\\n\\nMission\\n\\nThe College of Liberal and Fine Arts will meet the needs of the diverse population of Texas through quality research and creative work, exemplary teaching, and professional contributions to the community.\\nBack to Top\\n\\n\"),\n",

Indeed, this content is grounded in research that recognizes that the positive affirmation of a racial, ethnic, and/or cultural identity role ethnic studies courses provide functions to increase the retention, persistence, and graduation rates of students of color. As such, MAS courses helped to cultivate a new generation of educated public citizens empowered to improve the quality of life of Mexican-American and Chicana/o communities in San Antonio, Texas, and across the nation.\\nIn addition, a Bachelor's Degree of Arts in Mexican American Studies (MAS) enhances all fields of study and professions by providing cultural affirmation, appreciation for diversity, and an understanding of systemic inequities.\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAssociate Professor\\nRace, Ethnicity, Gender and Sexuality Studies\\nAbout\\nFaculty\\n\\nMAS Programs\\n\\nGiven the interdisciplinary of Mexican American Studies, a major in Mexican American Studies complements and adds value to all fields of study and professions; including education, business, law, public policy, health care, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. Another benefit of pursuing a MAS major comes from research that documents a correlation between ethnic studies curriculum and increased academic performance for students from racial or ethnic communities. As such, a recommended path for many students interested in learning more about Mexican American history, culture, and perspectives, is to double major in MAS and another field. Students can easily complete the 120 credit hours that allow them to earn a degree in Mexican American Studies and a different field. Furthermore, the academic rigor and critical consciousness-raising of the MAS program groom college students toward pursuing graduate degrees. If you are interested in pursuing a Master's or Doctoral degree, a MAS major readies you for the reading, writing, and theoretical challenges of graduate school.\\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Mexican American Studies is an interdisciplinary program that integrates foundational methodologies and theoretical frameworks in the field. Our MAS program is community-centered and grounded in the local, regional, and diasporic histories and cultural knowledge of Mexican American communities in Yanawana/San Antonio, South Texas, and beyond. Majors are required in:\\n- History\\n- Music\\n- Cultural studies\\n- Social justice\\nStudents enrolled in Mexican American Studies obtain theoretical knowledge and practical skills related to working with diverse populations, as well as research skills for developing, analyzing, and evaluating policies and practices impacting the Mexican American community. The program prepares students to become insightful, intellectual, and innovative thinkers and leaders who can work effectively in diverse and challenging contexts, with the following skills: problem-solving, interpersonal skills, public speaking, teamwork, leadership abilities, critical thinking, cultural sensitivity/awareness, flexibility, and adaptability.\\nEstablished in 1993, Mexican American Studies (MAS) continues the tradition of the Mexican American Civil Rights struggle by participating in the creation of a college-going culture for San Antonio and South Texas. It is housed in the Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Sexuality Studies department in the College of Education and Human Development. Currently, there are five full-time MAS faculty members, over 100 majors, and 80 double majors. The program has graduated close to 100 students.\\n\\nMAS Teachers Academy\\n\\n\\nAbout Mexican American Studies Teachers' Academy\\n\\n\\nScholar Activist response to prepare teachers\\n\\nAs part of the statewide movement to bring MAS into Texas public schools, UTSA MAS faculty Dr. Marie “Keta” Miranda created the MAS Teachers' Academy with the support of Dr. Marco Cervantes and graduate students. The academy is a community-powered, teacher-scholar-led effort that provides educators with foundational content and curricular support to teach MAS in PreK-12 public schools.\\nSince 2015, the MAS Teachers’ Academy has organized an annual, week-long professional development institute. Initially, it was designed for secondary social studies teachers who wanted to teach the Special Topics in Social Studies course, approved by the SBOE in 2014, and the Ethnic Studies: Mexican American Studies course, approved in 2018. It has since expanded to include primary and secondary education teachers who want to center MAS in their social studies, ELAR (English, Language Arts, and Reading), Spanish, mathematics, fine arts, science, and dual-language curricula.\\n\\nVision and Praxis\\n\\nIn 2020, the academy shifted to an online platform to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of moving the academy online, we have been able to increase attendance by providing access to participants state-wide.\\nOver the past few years, the academy has been able to count on the generous support of community partners like MACRI (Mexican American Civil Rights Institute) and IDRA (Intercultural Development Research Association), as well as expert MAS teachers. We also rely on the support of past and present MAS undergraduate students, graduate students, and community advocates.\\nAs the only academy of its kind in the state, the MAS Teachers’ Academy introduces teachers to Chicana/x/o Studies liberatory pedagogies and teaching/learning approaches that speak to MAS' commitment to student empowerment, community self-determination, and social transformation.\\nTeachers who participate in our summer academy receive professional development credits and have access to readings, scholar lectures, curriculum building workshops, pláticas, as well as archives and special exhibits like Los Tejanos at the Institute of Texan Cultures (ITC).\\nIn addition to our one-week summer academy, the MAS Teachers’ Academy offers Cafecito y MAS pláticas and teacher-led MAS workshops during the Fall and Spring semesters. Co-organized with Aurelio Montemayor of IDRA, these community gatherings and workshops provide educators with access to decolonial, Chicana feminist, and anti-racist pedagogies rooted in MAS.\\n\\nLand Acknowledgement\\n\\nWe acknowledge the Payaya – the people of Yanawana and the Tap Pilam Cuahuiltecans who are native to the South Texas and Northeast Mexico region, who live in occupied territory known as San Antonio. We also acknowledge the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation, whose traditional territory we are living on. You are the past, present, and future caretakers and knowledge keepers of this land. We also acknowledge the Lipan Apache, Tonkawa, Kickapoo, Comanche, and other Native nations who were displaced from their territories and migrated to these lands – who continue to care for Mother Earth and maintain their traditional ways.\\nAs a Hispanic Serving Institution built on Coahuiltecan land, we’d like for us to reflect on the words of Indigenous scholar Clelia Rodriguez who reminds us that “It is important that we acknowledge that we are working, teaching and learning on these lands and consider what responsibilities we carry and how we can engage in meaningful commitments/expressions of relationship, reciprocity and responsibility to land and water.”\\nAs MAS educators, we acknowledge that white supremacy has been an insidious system of domination that has assaulted Black communities on this continent and globally for centuries. As a program, we are committed to transdisciplinary frameworks that center the knowledge production and contributions of people of the African diaspora in our curricula as a way of creating greater consciousness around our shared histories of resistance, political struggles, and movements for collective liberation. We also commit to dismantling anti-Blackness in our curricula by centering the histories and realities of Black, Afro-Chicana/x, and Afro-Indigenous people who have, for too long, been erased in white supremacist and settler colonial narratives.\\n\\nFloricanto\\n\\nThis year, MAS teachers are invited to share a 250-word abstract that addresses how you’ve integrated floricanto in your MAS curriculum through Chicanx poetic language, Chicanx literature---including but not limited to Young Adult Literature, poetry, cuentos, short stories---teatro, performance, and other creative expressions in the classroom to:\\n- Celebrate heritage and cultivate political consciousness.\\n- Recover lost histories, preserve ancestral knowledge, and inspire social justice.\\n- Engender self-reflection (dialogue with the heart) with students as a way of deepening knowledge of the self in relation to community, the world and all our relations.\\n- Cultivate a sense of belonging and sacred purpose\\n- Create spaces of collective joy, dreaming, and beauty as “resistance/creation” (to borrow from Dr. Roberto “Cintli” Rodriguez).\\n\\nResources\\n\\n(April 25, 2019) In this podcast, Dr. Lilliana Saldaña and Vanessa Sandoval discuss efforts to create a Mexican American Studies course approved by the Texas State Board of Education with Dan Daniel G.

It is also the mission of the department to provide an environment for its faculty and students to engage in research that will further the understanding of economics and enhance the reputation of the Department, the College of Business, and the University.\\n\\nMaster of Arts Degree in Economics\\n\\nThe Master of Arts degree in Economics (M.A.E.) offers a program with modern quantitative methods and analytical tools suitable for a business-oriented or a social science-oriented study of economics. The program covers the essential theory of economics and econometrics but is primarily focused on applications and skill development. The program's design accommodates both students seeking a terminal degree in economics and students wishing to lay the groundwork to pursue a Ph.D. degree. Enrollment may be full-time or part-time.\\nThere are three concentrations—general economics, financial economics, and business data analysis and forecasting—to choose from. The general economics concentration is designed to offer flexibility in course planning and is suitable for students preparing for doctoral studies in economics or related disciplines, as well as for those with interdisciplinary interests. Under the general economics concentration, students with outstanding coursework or research experience may choose to write a thesis, though it is not required for the degree. The concentrations of financial economics and of business data analysis and forecasting are each designed with a selection of courses to offer students seeking careers in the private or public sectors the opportunity to learn and develop concentration-specific knowledge and practical skills. These two concentrations do not allow for a Master's thesis. The program is supervised by the Economics Graduate Director together with the Economics Graduate Programs Committee.\\n\\nProgram Admission Requirements\\n\\nFor admission to the M.A.E. program, applicants must meet University-wide graduate admission requirements. Applicants are further considered on the basis of potential for success in graduate study in economics as indicated by a combination of records in the application package, including:\\n- A completed application form.\\n- Transcripts from all universities attended.\\n- Official Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores.\\n- A statement of purpose.\\n- A letter of recommendation (additional letters are welcome but optional).\\n- (Optional) A résumé or curriculum vitae.\\nAt least one letter of recommendation from a university professor or instructor is appropriate, particularly for applicants with fewer than three years elapsed since the last semester of enrollment in an institution of higher education. Personal references should be avoided.\\nThe Graduate Admissions Committee evaluates each applicant individually based on the stated records. Accepted students are required to have completed an undergraduate degree before the start of the Master’s program.\\n\\nFoundation Requirements\\n\\nTo facilitate good progress in the degree program, students will require the following three bodies of knowledge upon enrollment in the program:\\n- Economic Theory: Undergraduate level of economic theory, including Intermediate Microeconomics and Intermediate Macroeconomics.\\n- Mathematics: An ability to apply calculus and linear algebra to equilibrium and optimization models in economics.\\n- Statistics: A basic knowledge of statistics, including probability distributions, sampling, and hypothesis testing.\\nThe Graduate Admissions Committee examines the application package to evaluate whether an applicant meets the foundation requirements, with significant consideration given to the record of courses taken and grades earned in the three areas. Students who are admitted to the program but determined not to meet adequately the foundation requirements may be required to fulfill conditions as stipulated by the Graduate Admissions Committee in order to provide the necessary foundation prior to or within the first year of enrollment into the program.\\nThe program admits students in both the Fall and Spring semesters. The core courses are scheduled on an annual basis in the form of a two-semester sequence beginning with the Fall semester.\\nStudents must complete 33 semester credit hours and a comprehensive examination. Students must earn 15 of the 33 semester credit hours from the core courses required for the program. The remaining 18 semester credit hours may include the credits that students can earn from an internship and a directed research project or a Master's Thesis, depending upon a student's chosen concentration.\\nStudents may do both an internship and a directed research paper (6 semester credit hours in total), or both an internship and a Master’s Thesis (9 semester credit hours in total), but not both a directed research paper and a Master's Thesis.\\nThis concentration offers students the flexibility to tailor the course plan to their specific interests.

The Department contributes to the field of knowledge through research and education in the quantitative sciences. Theory and analysis are applied to a variety of interdisciplinary problems to discover new approaches for meeting the challenges of decision making in a global arena of expanding technology and information.\\n\\nDepartment Information\\n\\nThe disciplines of Management Science and Statistics are integral to modern decision-making processes. These interdisciplinary fields emphasize the use of quantitative methods and computers for analyzing, understanding, visualizing, and interpreting data. Management Science seeks to provide a rational basis for decision analysis across a broad spectrum of business functions such as production/operations, marketing, finance, human resources, project management, logistics, and supply chain management. Statistical methods provide analytical tools for research in high-technology and biomedical industries, insurance, and government agencies. The Department also offers a Master of Science degree in Statistics and Data Science, a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Applied Statistics, and a Graduate Certificate in Operations and Supply Chain Management.\\nMaster of Science Degree in Statistics and Data Science\\nToday, the skills of statisticians and data scientists are in high demand. More organizations need individuals with knowledge of statistics and methods to collect, analyze, interpret data and communicate the results. These statisticians and data scientists are needed in areas such as biomedical fields and bioinformatics—to address drug development and health-related issues; environmental studies—to address pollution and contamination; as well as internet traffic, fraud detection, cyber security, and national defense—to mine data and to provide accurate predictions. Statisticians and data scientists are commonly employed in the industries such as insurance, health, IT companies, finance, biomedical research, manufacturing, service and others. In response to the growing demand for workers with the ability to design experiments, make predictions/forecasts and analyze large complex datasets, the Master of Science degree in Statistics and Data Science at UTSA includes instruction, in a broad range of applied statistical methods, computational tools, data-step training, and statistical/machine learning methods, to prepare students for careers as government officials, industrial workers, and academic statisticians or for pursuing a doctoral degree in statistics and data science fields.\\n\\nProgram Admission Requirements\\n\\nAll application materials must be submitted using the University's online application system and received by the program-specific Fall deadline. Degree-seeking students are only admitted in the Fall semester of each academic year.\\nIn addition to satisfying the University-wide graduate admission requirements, a B.A. or B.S. in statistics, mathematics, engineering, business, or a closely related field is highly recommended as preparation. In particular, the Admissions Committee requires applicants to complete Calculus I, II, and III, and a course in Matrix Theory/Linear Algebra prior to applying for the program. However, if necessary, the Linear Algebra/Matrix Theory course may be taken during the first semester of the program (in addition to degree requirements).

However, the encouraging environment at UTSA motivated me to see what happens if I fully apply myself.\\nI came in as a freshman with my mind set on one major; however, after talking to some industry professionals at one of the many career days UTSA hosts, I decided electrical engineering was a better fit for me, and I have never looked back. I got involved with several student organizations from professional ones like IEEE and Engineering Without Borders, to some more fun ones like Latin Dance Society. The summer after my freshman year, I applied and got into the Unmanned Systems Lab at UTSA, and there I’ve been doing groundbreaking research for the past three years.\\nNow in my senior year, I have a 4.0 GPA and I’m a member of the Honors College, a Hispanic Scholarship Fund Scholar, an Eisenhower Transportation Fellow, and I received three worldwide scholarships from the International Society of Automation. I completed internships with the Department of Defense, Michelin Tires and the legendary Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.\\nLooking back at all I’ve achieved is truly humbling, and I would not be here without UTSA.\\nmajor:\\nyear:\\nhometown:\\n\\nExplore more of UTSA\\n\\n\\nLINK: https://future.utsa.edu/collegetour/jesus/\\nTITLE: Jesus Guillen Jr. - UTSA Admissions\\nCONTENT:\\n\\nJesus Guillen Jr.\\n\\n“UTSA has given me a more insight into what I want to do…”\\n\\nMeet Jesus\\n\\nGrowing up, I always knew that I wanted to study engineering. This started back in high school in the Rio Grande Valley, with an interest in VEX Robotics and competitions. I am currently a member of the Honors College, and I am also a member of the Top Scholar program, which is a last-dollar full-ride program — we are a community of 40 intellectually curious students and we are like family. I truly am blessed to have been in both of these programs. I’ve been able to travel to the University of Maine for a research experience funded by the National Science Foundation, as well as the University of North Texas. I also participated in a conference for minority-serving institutions at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\\nI have also competed in the Big Rowdy Idea, which is the entrepreneurship competition organized by UTSA Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Last year, a group of my close friends and I created a start-up company for a smart watch through this competition. It was a great collaboration between engineering students and business students. And with the help of some amazing mentors, our Big Rowdy Idea won second place in the competition!\\nI’ve also been involved all across campus. I’ve held leadership roles in the Rowdy Chess Club, the Top Scholars Student Organization and the Eta Kappa Nu honor society for electrical and computer engineers.\\nmajor:\\nyear:\\nhometown:\\n\\nExplore more of UTSA'),\n",

If you are an undergraduate student, please do not hesitate to contact research groups on campus to learn more about getting involved! Furthermore, there are funded research opportunities for undergraduate students such as the NSF REU program (below).\\nT\\nhe REU site at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)\\nis funded by National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It\\nwill host\\nten undergraduate students\\nfrom colleges nationwide to conduct research on applications of artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous vehicles based on 5G communications.\\n(Put a link of Application page)\\nRapidly deploying 5G core networks have enhanced mobility and service provisioning while increasing the amount and complexity of the data. Integrating AI into 5G networks could effectively orchestrate applications such as autonomous driving of unmanned vehicles and optimal charging management of electric vehicles. Autonomous vehicles, 5G communication network, and AI have been identified as national priorities to enhance the leadership of the U.S. in future technologies. However, there is a lack of students entering the workforce or graduate schools in this area, in particular female and underrepresented students. The REU site at the University of Texas at San Antonio is designed to train undergraduate students with hands-on research activities on AI, autonomous vehicles, and 5G networks with direct mentorship by faculty mentors. The REU site also seeks to encourage the REU participants to pursue their studies for graduate degrees in STEM, which is imperative to enhance the competitiveness of the future workforce.\\nThe\\ngoal\\nof this project is to equip undergraduate students with knowledge and skills of the latest engineering research on AI, robotics, autonomous driving, and optimal charging of electric vehicles in 5G mobile networks. The designed REU projects address the frontier research problems through hands-on applications, such as practical assembly of real robotics, data collection with 5G mobile devices, data processing with AI algorithms, building charging converters for electrical vehicles, and establishing a framework for control and communication between multiple unmanned vehicles. These are valuable activities for novice undergraduate researchers to gain direct research experiences. The REU site will also integrate the learn-practice-service cycle into research activities, encourage team spirit, and build students’ self-esteem by recognition and rewards for achievements. The REU program integrates research and education activities to enable REU students to develop essential skills through various training sessions, hands-on lab activities, and seminars on research and career development. The research activities are also integrated with outreach activities to local communities including field trips to the NIWEEK event and local industries.\\n\\nHave an inquiry about our program?\\n\\nWe appreciate your interest in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at UTSA and extend our warmest welcome to you from the Department.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n\\nStay Connected to the Klesse College of Engineering and Integrated Design\\n\\n\\nUTSA Mission\\n\\nThe University of Texas at San Antonio is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge through research and discovery, teaching and learning, community engagement and public service.

This department harnesses the complementary fields of sociology and demography, equipping you with a diverse set of tools to critically analyze the world and your place in it. Given the unprecedented challenges facing society today – rising inequality, health disparities, the aging of the population, increasing social divisions, to name just a few – a degree in one or both of these fields is more important than ever.\\nIn our sociology and demography programs you will gain a deeper understanding of current social problems facing society, sociological and demographic theories and concepts used to analyze their causes and consequences, as well as social policies and programs aimed to address them. Moreover, our demography programs and coursework contribute an understanding of the size, distribution, composition and growth of human populations. In addition, you will fine tune your critical thinking skills, and be exposed to a diverse set of analytical skills that are in high demand by employers, including qualitative methods, quantitative statistical analysis, demographic techniques, and program evaluation.\\nThe department offers unique programs at the undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels that prepare students for a wide variety of careers in health care, social service agencies, academic settings (whether for graduate school or academic research and teaching), government and non-profit organizations, as well as the private sector. These programs include:\\n- Bachelor of Arts in Sociology\\n- Bachelor of Science in Health, Aging and Society\\n- Master of Science in Applied Demography\\n- Master of Science in Sociology\\n- Ph.D. in Applied Demography\\nWhichever program you choose, you'll gain access to a world-class faculty engaged in cutting-edge research in areas such as social disparities in health and mortality, racial and ethnic relations, demographic and population studies, immigration and border studies, the sociology of religion, stratification and social mobility, adolescent and young adult well-being, aging and life course, the sociology of religion, and cultural sociology.\\nFittingly for our location in the College for Health, Community and Policy, many faculty engage in research connected to the community, including the State of Texas, the City of San Antonio, UT Health, Methodist Healthcare, area high schools and the Alamo Colleges, and the San Antonio Military Medical Center. Our faculty include the State Demographer of Texas, and others Direct or are affiliated with the Institute for Health Disparities Research and Institute for Demographic and Socioeconomic Research. Reflecting our global reach, some faculty engage in research collaborations in Mexico, China, France, and across the world.\\nThis brief sketch only scratches the surface of potential opportunities for students in sociology and demography. I invite you to contact me or one of our program advisors (Joanne Ford- Robertson or Ying Huang), to stop by to tour our facilities and meet our faculty, staff and students, and to learn more about what we have to offer!\\n\\nContact\\n\\nDepartment Chair, Professor\\nSociology and Demography\\nStudents\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- Main Building 2.306\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n- 210-458-7900\\n\\nStay Connected to the College for Health, Community and Policy (HCAP)\\n\\n\\nMission\\n\\nThe mission of the College for Health, Community and Policy (HCAP) is to develop solutions to affect change for complex social issues to improve the well-being of communities and the world.

Her research and clinical expertise centers on progressing the treatment of severe behavior in children with autism and developmental disabilities with the science of applied behavior analysis (ABA). Severe behavior (e.g., aggression, self-injury, and property destruction) limits children’s access to learning, social, and communication opportunities and can be particularly concerning due to the serious potential health side effects (e.g., concussion from head banging) and long-term harmful outcomes (e.g., increased risk of institutionalization). Therapy based on the science of ABA is based on the principles of reinforcement learning and focuses on identifying the function (or purpose) of a behavior and arranging environmental contingencies to favor functional communication over severe behavior. Recently, Dr. Neely has partnered with colleagues in computer science, engineering, cyber security, education, health, and kinesiology, to establish an innovative lab focused on integrating advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality, into the therapy and education of children with autism and developmental disabilities. Dr. Neely holds multiple leadership positions including Associate Editor of the Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities and Advances in Neurodevelopmental Disorders. She is also Associate Director of the Brain Health Consortium and Program Director of the Behavior Analysis Program. Finally, Dr. Neely is serving on the Executive Council for Texas Association of Behavior Analysis as a Member-at-Large.\\n\\nTeaching\\n\\n- Behavior assessment\\n- Single-case research methodology\\n- Advanced Behavior Analysis\\n- Advanced Single-case research methodology\\n\\nResearch Interests\\n\\n- Behavior analysis\\n- Severe behavior\\n- Autism\\n- Intellectual and developmental disabilities\\n- Artificial intelligence\\n- Machine learning\\n- Interventions to improve quality of life\\n\\nDegrees\\n\\n- Ph.D., Educational Psychology, Texas A&M University, 2015\\n- M.Ed., Applied Behavior Analysis and Special Education, Texas A&M University, 2012\\n- B.S., Civil Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, 2006\\n\\nRecent Media and Clips\\n\\n\\nHonors and Awards\\n\\n\\nPresentations\\n\\n- Carnett, A., & Neely, L., Chen, M.

Our diverse teacher candidates are well-prepared to work with diverse students, including English Learners and special populations; and are prepared to integrate technology into their practices.\\n\\nPride Points\\n\\n- Augmenting support and services to school districts in the San Antonio region through innovative programming including the nationally recognized Dual Language Partnership with the San Antonio ISD, with which we engage collaboratively in prioritizing research-driven pedagogy, instruction, and practices for dual language settings. In accordance with UTSA’s legacy as a community-serving institution, this partnership strives for authenticity, engagement, and reciprocity, capitalizing on the collective assets brought by school district personnel, UTSA faculty/staff, parents, and community stakeholders.\\n- South Bexar Urban School Leaders Collaborative (USLC) Cohort – donor-funded program aimed at preparing equity-conscious principals for historically underserved settings (e.g., SAISD, Edgewood ISD).\\n- Streamlining teacher preparation degree programs (Equity and Education degree) which create options for students to choose either a bilingual or ESL track and reorganize/consolidate curriculum to reduce degree credit requirements (now 120 credit hours). We anticipate that this will address critical skill needs and the teacher labor market.\\n- Working with City Ed Partners and US Prep to facilitate a more rigorous and meaningful clinical teacher experience that includes impactful mentoring and compensated, yearlong residencies.\\n- Collaboration with CAST Teach High School in Northside ISD where HS students earn college credit and take educator preparation courses at UTSA.\\n- The Signature Teacher Residency: We are working with several school districts (Edgewood ISD, Harlandale ISD, Northside ISD, Northeast ISD, San Antonio ISD, Somerset ISD, and East Central ISD) to implement paid residencies for our clinical teachers. These partnerships require that we address teacher preparedness and shortages through shared governance.\\n- UTSA’s Dual Credit Teacher Pathway initiatives: We are working with three school districts (North East ISD, SAISD, and Northside ISD) to implement a dual credit pathway for high school students to enter into teacher education programs. At the moment we’re trying to strengthen these partnerships so that we can maximize the number of high school students who complete the program and actually enter into our teacher education program.\\nThe OPPP supports students pursuing certification and licensure by overseeing accredited programs, and by creating and sustaining partnerships with school districts, community and business entities, hospitals, and other industries.\\nIf you are interested in pursuing a degree or certificate that leads to certification and/or licensure, please follow these links:\\n\\nEducator Preparation (Certification) and Licensure Programs Offered\\n\\n- Undergraduate (60+ Hours) (initial)\\n- Bilingual & ESL specialists\\n- Completed Baccalaureate in another field (computer science, Math, English, etc.)\\n- Secondary (7-12 Grade) (computer science, Math, English Language Arts, etc.)\\n- All level (Art, Music, PE, special Ed.)\\n- Master's Degree with Teacher Certification\\n- School Counselor, Reading Specialist, Principal, Superintendent\\n- Master's degree + Bilingual and ESL Generalists\\n\\nAdvanced Professional\\n\\n- Certification & Licensure\\n- Behavior Analyst, Professional Counselor, School Psychologist, Dietetics\\nThe OPPP supports UTSA’s Bold Futures Initiative and COEHD’s partnership initiatives for optimizing opportunities, transforming lives, and creating endless possibilities for learners, faculty, staff, and community alike.

Prior to academia, he worked as a project engineer for the Department of Defense, Rio Tinto, and FLSmidth Minerals. Dr. Mejia’s work seeks to analyze and describe the assets, tensions, contradictions, and cultural collisions many Latino/a/x students experience in engineering through pláticas and testimonios. His research has contributed to the integration of critical theoretical frameworks in engineering education to investigate deficit ideologies and their impact on minoritized communities. He is particularly interested in approaches that contribute to a more expansive understanding of engineering in sociocultural contexts, engineering education in bilingual contexts, and the impact of critical consciousness in engineering practice.

Contact the appropriate advisor of record or individual research faculty member to discuss the alignment of your research interests.\\nResearch-Active Faculty\\nPrograms\\nResearch\\nStudents\\n\\nResearch Areas\\n\\nThe Aquatic Science area of study emphasizes the multidisciplinary study of aquatic ecosystems and the conservation plans and management strategies to protect them. Aquatic science focuses on biotic and abiotic aspects of freshwater ecosystems from the cellular level to ecosystems. Freshwater ecosystems include aquifers, ephemeral and perennial streams and rivers, lakes, reservoirs, ephemeral rivers, wetlands, riparian habitat, and the interactions between aquatic and terrestrial habitat.\\nSub-disciplines range from genetics to community structure of organisms, ecosystem and physical processes, climate change, and linkages between freshwater ecosystems and surrounding landscapes. Applied aspects include habitat and water quality assessment, indicator species, conservation, fisheries science, invasive species management, integrated water resource management, watershed assessment, human impacts, and restoration. Students in this field will combine their understanding of biology and species interactions with their understanding of policy and regulations for the betterment of the ecosystem and environmental health.\\n\\nWhat can you do with an Aquatic Science Area of Study?\\n\\nStudents pursuing an aquatic sciences area of study will be well suited for careers in natural resources specifically focused on aquatic systems. Government agencies - from municipal to federal levels - employ graduates with an aquatic science background to conduct research projects or direct fisheries management programs in freshwater and marine ecosystems. Many nonprofit agencies also employ graduates with this background to manage and research areas of aquatic resource conservation.\\n- Fisheries Biologist\\n- Aquaculture Biologist\\n- Benthic Ecologist\\n- Hydrologist\\n- Marine Biologist\\n- Park Ranger\\n- Conservation Officer\\n- Stream Ecologist\\n- Water Quality Regulator\\n- Wildlife Biologist\\n- Water Treatment Scientist\\nConservation and restoration ecologists and biologists apply ecology, biology, genetics, behavioral and population dynamics, and sustainability principles in the protection of biological diversity in healthy ecosystems and habitats as well as the restoration of damaged and degraded ecosystems and habitats. The disciplines of conservation and restoration ecology recognize the inherent value of various species and the system-wide processes and services they provide to the global environment.\\n\\nWhat can you do with a Conservation and Restoration Ecology Area of Study?\\n\\nThe Conservation and Restoration Ecology area of study will prepare you for positions collecting and analyzing data for private environmental consulting firms and governmental agencies. These positions are prominently in the areas such as: delineation and restoration of wetlands, fire damaged woodlands, and overgrazed rangelands. Positions may include investigation and determination of native species reintroduction, and invasive species control.\\nThe Natural Resources and Wildlife Management area of study focuses on the behavior and populations of species, and the conservation plans and management strategies developed to protect those species – including their habitats. Students in this field will combine their understanding of biology and species interactions with their understanding of policy and regulations for the betterment of the species, ecosystems and environmental health.\\n\\nWhat can you do with a Natural Resources and Wildlife Management Area of Study?\\n\\nStudents pursuing a Natural Resource and Wildlife Management area of study will be well suited for careers in natural resources specifically focused on management, regulatory agencies, and wildlife biology. Government agencies - from municipal to federal levels - employ graduates with a natural resource and/or wildlife management background to conduct research projects or to direct land management programs in public parks, nature areas, and game lands. Many nonprofit agencies employ graduates with this background to manage their environmental holdings such as a conservancy, preserve or wetland.\\nPlants are vital components of the biosphere contributing oxygen and organic compounds to sustain life on earth. Through complex biochemical pathways, plants can monitor environmental resources such as minerals and water, and external signals such as light and temperature, to optimize growth, development, and yield. In addition to perceiving non-living factors such as those listed above, plants also recognize and respond to other living organisms through the production of complex specialized metabolites. Interactions of plants with other organisms can be positive, such as the production of pigments and fragrances by flowers to attract pollinators. In other cases, plants react to herbivores and pathogens by mounting defense responses. Not only can plant-derived specialized metabolites defend plants from attack, many of these compounds have therapeutic properties in the human body and are used as medicines to fight pain, inflammation, infections, and cancer.\\nStudents doing research with faculty can work on intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways by studying plant hormones, plant-insect interactions, and plant-virus interactions. They will receive training in many different techniques including those for DNA, RNA and protein extraction, purification, and analysis; electrophoresis; chromatography; mass spectrometry; and microscopy. These techniques are useful for scientists pursuing careers in many areas of basic and applied sciences.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n\\nVision\\n\\nThe College of Sciences envisions itself as a leading institution of higher learning in sciences and mathematics, with local and global impact.\\nBack to Top\\n\\n'),\n",

The Biology FIG is for students majoring in biology that want to get a jumpstart on biology and chemistry content. There are several benefits in joining a FIG.\\n\\nBiology FIG Benefits\\n\\n- Registration process very easy, your classes have been blocked especially for you.\\n- Only those students selected for the Biology FIG will be allowed to register for those blocked courses.\\n- Living and learning with students with similar interests and your major\\n- Built-in study group.\\n- Experience a small community within a large university.\\n- Peer Mentors crossed trained as supplemental instructors.\\n- Build a strong academic foundation.\\n- Designated floors within a residence hall, early move in date.\\n- Special Orientation\\n\\nBiology FIG Block Scheduling\\n\\nFreshmen in their first semester have a great opportunity to take multiple core classes with the same cohort of students. Block schedules help create connections amongst peers both academically, as well as socially within their Academic Studies. A block schedule is a pre-set schedule that includes AIS and two other courses in academic studies.\\nEnrolling in a block schedule allows first-year students to meet peers who share similar interests, have a built-in study group and support network, and complete classes that apply to their major.\\n- Simplifies the registration process.\\n- Ensures you are taking the courses for your academic program.\\n- Offers the best opportunity to register for a full-time schedule.\\n- Creates opportunities to find study partners and make new friends among the students in your block.\\nStudents selected to join the Biology FIG will have the following courses blocked:\\n\\nBiology FIG Faculty\\n\\nFaculty for each Biology FIG Course were selected to support science-loving students who are interested in a biology degree and/or career. They will discuss potential pathways in biology, including academic research, industry, and medicine, and help you explore the different resources on campus that can help you become involved in undergraduate research. You will learn about the research process, professionalism, how to find a faculty mentor, and how to succeed in college. Students will be able to participate in social events with faculty.\\n\\nBiology FIG Peer Mentors\\n\\nBiology FIG students will be paired with a Peer Mentor, a dedicated and experienced upper-classmen who has been specially trained to help new students make the transition to university life. They provide support and guidance to students on a variety of challenges and help students get further connected to the university.\\nThe Biology FIG Peer Mentors are crossed trained as Supplemental Instructors. Supplemental Instruction is a series of weekly study sessions offered to students enrolled in historically difficult courses at UTSA. If you attend SI sessions weekly, chances are you'll earn a better grade. In fact, students who attend SI sessions regularly tend to average one half to one full letter grade higher than their classmates who do not attend SI.\\nIn SI sessions, students work together to review lecture notes and text material, prepare for tests and improve learning strategies. SI sessions are guided by students who successfully completed the course and who are trained to facilitate collaborative study groups. SI sessions provide an opportunity for you to learn how to learn while learning what to learn.\\n\\nAcademic Support\\n\\nNot only do all Biology FIG students benefit from having a Peer Mentor trained as a Supplemental Instructor, they will also have direct access to an Academic Coach. Academic Coaching is the one-on-one process of helping students identify their strengths and weaknesses, then devising a personalized approach to studying. Academic Coaches can help with everything from organizing and managing your time better to overcoming challenges with long term writing projects to enhancing your presentation skills.\\n\\nAcademic Advising\\n\\nUTSA Academic Advisors offer academic advising and guidance to empower students to realize their full potential. For this reason, each student has an assigned professional Biology FIG academic advisor so the student can establish a strong mentoring relationship with her or his advisor, whom he or she may consult on all academic and curricular issues.\\n\\nHousing\\n\\nStudents selected to join the Biology FIG will be required to live on campus for their first year. Why live on campus? Studies show students who reside on campus report a higher degree of satisfaction with their college experience, have higher retention and graduation rates, and are more likely to achieve a higher grade point average.\\nThe convenience of living on campus is invaluable. Students are within walking distance of the library, classroom buildings, the University Center, dining options, Health Services, and the Campus Recreation Center. They can get to early morning classes without fighting traffic, and participate in a late-night study group at the library or University Center without concern about the drive home. On-campus residents also have the added security of a dedicated university police force that patrols the campus 24 hours a day.\\n\\nScience Leadership\\n\\nEmployers have identified key skills and traits they seek when hiring a recent college graduate. These skills also lay the foundation for effective leadership which is necessary to advance in most fields, especially for those students interested in academic research and heath profession programs. To help UTSA students prepare for the challenges they will face both during their college years and beyond, Student Leadership Center is offering training in marketable leadership skills. As a member of the Biology FIG, students will have access to this training during your first year. This training is organized in three levels allowing you to advance as far as you choose to go.\\nScience Mentoring\\nResearch\\nEvents and Organizations\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n\\nVision\\n\\nThe College of Sciences envisions itself as a leading institution of higher learning in sciences and mathematics, with local and global impact.\\nBack to Top\\n\\n\"),\n",

Additionally, the COS Signature Experience Program offers options for students to capture qualifying experiences on their transcript through credit and non-credit based courses.\\n\\nCategories of COS Signature Experiences\\n\\nExperiential learning requires two main elements: (1) learn by doing and (2) reflection on this learning as it relates to one's field of study and skills gained (marketable skills). There are five general categories for experiential learning that could serve as a COS Signature Experience.\\nEach COS department has its own minimum requirements for what constitutes a qualifying experiential learning experience for each category. Visit your major department's website for those requirements.\\n\\nPre-Approved Course-Based Experiences\\n\\nSeveral COS majors already have experiential learning opportunities build into their programs, which qualifies as a COS Signature Experience, and some programs offer the possibility of earning academic credit towards the degree for qualifying signature experiences. The following courses have been pre-approved by the College of Sciences to count as a COS Signature Experience. Note that students have to successfully complete the course(s) with a C- or better for letter grade-based courses or CR for CR/NC courses for it to count as a COS Signature Experience.\\n\\nZero-Hour Courses\\n\\nStudents may apply to have a qualifying experiential learning experience captured in a zero-hour course that will be shown on their academic transcript upon successful completion. There is one course for each category of experiential learning for lower division students (1000 level) and upper division students (4000 level).\\n- SCI 1100.

Contact the appropriate advisor of record or individual research faculty member to discuss the alignment of your research interests.\\nResearch\\nStudents\\n\\nResearch Areas\\n\\nModern analytical chemistry is focused to a large extent on instrumental analysis. It involves new applications, new methods of analysis, discovery of new principles of measurements, and application of other discoveries (e.g. microchip devices, lasers, plasma) for qualitative and quantitative measurements. Analytical chemistry makes important contributions to a diverse set of fields including industry, forensics, medicine, biology, physics, archaeology, geology, homeland security, food science, space science, and nanotechnology.\\nStudents conducting research with analytical faculty receive training in different areas including chromatography, electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, electrochemistry, microscopy, spectroscopy, and hyphenated techniques. These skills, together with the interdisciplinary training, serve well during the job search after graduation.\\nParticipating Faculty\\nBiochemistry is the study of the chemicals and processes of living things. It is essential to medicine (it is the only branch of chemistry taught in medical schools), drug discovery, and discovery of how life processes are altered by the environment and pathology. Other than the simple biochemicals and lipids, there are the macromolecules, including proteins and DNA. Determining the structure of these and how various drugs and other chemicals bind to them is the basis of modern drug design. Another branch of biochemistry, molecular biology, exploits the properties of DNA to allow nearly any gene to be isolated, modified, and expressed in nearly unlimited quantities. Biochemists also collaborate with cell biologists to learn how the proteins (proteomics) and DNA (genomics) differ between living things and as organisms respond to their environment (cell signaling).\\nStudents conducting research with biochemical faculty receive training in different techniques including chromatography, electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, microscopy, spectroscopy, and hyphenated techniques, as well as more specialized techniques. These skills, together with the interdisciplinary training, serve well during the job search after graduation.\\nThe design and synthesis of new compounds and the discovery of new metalloproteins has led to the discovery of unusual and highly complex structures, many of which contain multiple metal centers. Inorganic chemistry employs the whole range of modern instrumentation to analyze and characterize new compounds, including single crystal X-ray structure determination, several types of spectroscopy, electrochemical methods, magnetic susceptibility, computational methods, and others.\\nOrganic chemistry involves the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of compounds and materials that contain carbon atoms.\\nThe UTSA Organic Section offers exciting research and training opportunities on the synthesis and functions of organic compounds in both the traditional fields of synthetic and physical organic chemistry and in the emerging interdisciplinary fields of green (environmentally benign), bio-organic, medicinal, and materials chemistry. Areas of strength include the developments of green catalysts and synthetic methodologies, drug delivery systems, and therapeutically useful small organic compounds.\\nStudents are strongly encouraged to visit the websites of the organic chemistry faculty to further explore the highlights and details of their ongoing research.\\nResearch in the area of physical chemistry can be broken into Atmospheric Chemistry, Biophysics, Electronic Structure, Material Processing, Nanofabrication, Reaction Dynamics, and Surface Chemistry. Many of these areas involve a unique collaboration between experimentalists and theorists with the goal of understanding fundamental processes such as energy transfer in activated complexes, gain further understanding of fundamental reaction mechanism such as proton transfer in peptides.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n\\nVision\\n\\nThe College of Sciences envisions itself as a leading institution of higher learning in sciences and mathematics, with local and global impact.\\nBack to Top\\n\\n'),\n",

In these sessions, guided by trained students who have successfully completed the course work, students work together to improve learning strategies by reviewing course material and preparing for tests. Students who attend SI sessions regularly tend to average one half to one full letter grade higher than their classmates who do not attend SI.\\n\\nChemistry Undergraduate Scholarships\\n\\nThe Department of Chemistry offers the following scholarships to Chemistry undergraduate Students.\\n- Janice and Michael Doyle Endowed Research Award in Chemistry\\n\\nFeatured Awards for Freshman, Sophomores, and Juniors\\n\\nThe following awards are granted to our undergraduate chemistry students who display a significant aptitude in their recognized specific field of chemistry and are recognized at the end of the semester graduation ceremonies.\\n- Undergraduate Award in General Chemistry\\n- Chemistry Department Award for Excellence in Chemical Sciences\\n- Undergraduate Award in Biochemistry\\n- Undergraduate Award in Analytical Chemistry\\n- Undergraduate Award in Physical Chemistry\\n- Undergraduate Award in Organic Chemistry\\n- Undergraduate Award in Inorganic Chemistry\\n\\nALEKS Chemistry Exam\\n\\nAssessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) is a Web-based, artificially intelligent assessment and learning system. ALEKS uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows and doesn’t know in a course. ALEKS then instructs the student on the topics they are most ready to learn. As a student works through a course, ALEKS periodically reassesses the student to ensure that topics learned are also retained. ALEKS courses are very complete in their topic coverage and avoids multiple-choice questions. A student who shows a high level of mastery of an ALEKS course will be successful in the actual course they are taking.\\nStudents need to achieve a 70% or higher on the learning modules in order to meet the readiness standards that are required by the UTSA Chemistry department for success in General Chemistry, CHEM 1103. Students who meet one of the following criteria below also meet the established criteria for success in General Chemistry, CHEM 1103:\\n- A grade of C- or higher in Basic Chemistry, CHEM 1073\\n- AP Chemistry score of 3 or higher\\nStudents may take the ALEKS Chemistry Exam in order to bypass CHEM 1073: Basic Chemistry.\\nThe UTSA Chemistry department has access to all ALEKS Chemistry rosters and student progress measures. Progress completed within the ALEKS system may take up to 48 hours to appear in the Banner student system due to processing times. So plan to complete well ahead of any registration deadlines to allow for transfer of data.\\nPlease note that using the ALEKS system, you will be charged a $60 NON-REFUNDABLE fee, which will be added to your UTSA Tuition and Fees bill. Each student may use the ALEKS Chemistry system (which is separate from the ALEKS Math system) for 18 weeks before resubscription and payment is required to access the system\\n\\nALEKS Math Exam\\n\\nIn order for students to excel in our Chemistry courses, it is recommended to start in Calculus I (MAT 1213).

These handbooks are rich in information and context for students involved in School Counseling, Clinical Mental Health Counseling, Ph.D. in Counselor Education, and Clinical (Practice and Internship) experiences.\\nPrograms\\nResources\\nTraining\\n\\nObjectives of the Counseling Program\\n\\nDepartment Mission-Based Student Learning Objectives (MBO)\\nAt the completion of the counseling program, students will be able to:\\n- Articulate a conceptualization of client/student presenting concerns from a strength-based perspective founded on contextual factors (e.g., developmental, relational, and multicultural).\\n- Describe how relational and diverse contextual factors may contribute to presenting problems.\\n- Discuss how relational competencies (i.e. authenticity, mutuality, honesty, empathy) affect counselor/client/student development.\\n- Describe how to creatively and effectively integrate contextual resources and client/student strengths during the counseling process.\\n- Demonstrate inclusive communication when describing clients/students (e.g., understanding and appropriately using people/person-first language or identity-first language, avoiding labeling clients/students).\\n- Demonstrate the ability to convey to the client/student their counseling progress.\\n\\nClinical Mental Health Counseling Objectives\\n\\nIn addition to the basic objectives listed above, those completing the program with an emphasis in clinical mental health counseling will:\\n- Demonstrate knowledge of the foundations of clinical mental health counseling, including roles, functions, credentialing, licensure, and professional identity of mental health counselors;\\n- Demonstrate knowledge of policies, laws, legislation, reimbursement, right-to-practice, and other issues relevant to clinical mental health counselors in a culturally diverse society;\\n- Demonstrate knowledge of the roles of the counselor in various community settings; organizational and legal dimensions of those settings; and general principles of community intervention, consultation, education, and outreach\\n- Demonstrate knowledge of principles for diagnosis and the use of current diagnostic tools;\\n- Demonstrate knowledge of principles and models of biopsychosocial assessment and case conceptualization in a culturally diverse society;\\n- Demonstrate knowledge of program development and delivery to diverse populations, including prevention, support groups, parent education, career/occupational information and counseling, and self-help;\\n- Demonstrate knowledge of effective strategies for promoting client understanding of and access to community resources; modalities for initiating, maintaining, and terminating counseling services with diverse populations.\\n\\nSchool Counseling Objectives\\n\\nIn addition to the basic objectives previously listed, those completing the program with an emphasis in school counseling will:\\n- Demonstrate the competencies required to work with all students in K-12 individually or in groups to address their personal, social, academic, and career concerns;\\n- Demonstrate consultative and coordinating competencies required to work collaboratively with parents, educators, other professionals, and community stakeholders to address the developmental needs of all students;\\n- Demonstrate knowledge of the role and function of the professional school counselor, including professional standards and behaviors as described in Texas Education Agency\\'s A Model Comprehensive, Developmental Guidance, and Counseling Program and the American School Counselor Association\\'s National Standards for School Counselors;\\n- Demonstrate the competencies necessary to conduct research and use assessment data in order to develop, implement, and maintain a data-driven comprehensive and developmental guidance program\\n\\nHow Do Our Programs Rate?\\n\\nThe Council for Accreditation of Counseling & Related Education Programs (CACREP) collects information from universities and colleges with accredited programs and publishes the CACREP Vital Statistics. Individual programs, rather than the university or college, receive accreditation from CACREP, and the Vital Statistics can be used by potential students to gauge the health of a particular program. The number of graduates, completion rate, pass rate on credentialing exams, and placement rate data can be used to judge how each program prepares and progresses its students toward the ultimate goal of gaining employment as a licensed counselor.\\n\\nM.S. Clinical Mental Health Counseling\\n\\nLast year, 101 students graduated from the Clinical Mental Health Counseling (CMHC) program. The pass rate for the National Counselor Examination (NCE) was 88%. Based on available data, an estimated 78% of graduates seeking jobs were able to secure employment in a counseling-related position within 180 days of graduation. The estimated completion time for full-time students enrolled in the CMHC program is 2.5-3.5 years; 79% of students admitted in Fall 2019 graduated on this schedule.\\n\\nM.Ed.

No certification or licensure exam is required for doctoral students beyond the entry-level requirements.\\n\\nThe Sarabia Family Counseling Center\\n\\nThe Sarabia Family Counseling Center is located on UTSA\\'s Downtown Campus in the Durango Building, Room 3.304. The SFCC offers free counseling services to the community for individuals, couples, and families. Services are provided by master\\'s and doctoral-level counseling students and are supervised by university faculty. To make an appointment, please call (210) 458-2055. The SFCC\\'s physical address is 501 W. César E. Chávez Blvd., San Antonio, TX 78207.\\nWe envision the UTSA SFCC as a national leader in clinical service, education, and research. Our mission is to promote healthy social, emotional, and relational functioning, reflecting the needs of a diverse and dynamic society. The SFCC is organized and oriented towards three simple goals:\\n- Promoting the highest quality of counseling service and care.\\n- Promoting excellence in counseling through supervised clinical training.\\n- Promoting counseling service and care through clinical research.\\nLocated on UTSA’s Downtown Campus, the SFCC was created with the primary purpose of serving San Antonio\\'s urban downtown area and its surrounding communities. We have an extensive resource center, equipped with counseling-related texts, assessments, technology, and other tools that promote active community service, clinical training, and clinical research.\\n\\nCommunity Services\\n\\nCurrently, the UTSA Sarabia Family Counseling Center (SFCC) and the Department of Counseling provide free counseling and psycho-educational services to the community through university-sponsored clinics and community partnerships. UTSA students have the opportunity to use the SFCC for both practicum and internship hours. SFCC also offers a variety of neurofeedback services.\\n\\nPartnerships\\n\\n\\nJuvenile Justice Partnership\\n\\nThe SFCC works closely with the caseworkers and judges at the municipal courthouse to provide counseling services to adjudicated youth. These services include individual and family counseling at the SFCC and psychoeducational groups offered at the municipal courthouse. These groups service at-risk youth and their parents and focus on parenting skills, healthy communication, and character building.\\n\\nAVANCE Partnership\\n\\nThe SFCC also works in collaboration with AVANCE, a community agency that strengthens families in at-risk communities through effective parent education and support programs. Staff and students from the SFCC provide educational outreach programs on parenting, mental health, and wellness in addition to providing counseling services to referred families.\\n\\nJuror Counseling Program\\n\\nThe SFCC partners with district courts to offer free counseling services to community members after serving on jury duty. After trials, some jurors experience sleep problems, stress, guilt, hopelessness, or frustration with the legal system. The UTSA Sarabia Family Counseling Center offers a safe and supportive environment where individuals can discuss their experiences related to jury duty and collaborate with their counselors to identify and implement solutions for optimal health and wellness.\\n\\nHarlandale ISD Partnership\\n\\nThe counseling department also collaborates with Harlandale Independent School District. Counseling services are provided to at-risk youth and their families as a part of the Harlendale ISD first-time offenders program. UTSA counseling students and professors provide group counseling on a weekly basis to middle school students, high school students, and their families.\\n\\nUTSA Sarabia Family Counseling Center\\n\\n\\nClinical Director\\n\\nAssistant Professor of Practice\\nCounseling\\n\\nTraining in Neurofeedback\\n\\nThe UTSA neurofeedback program is the only training program in the nation accredited by the Biofeedback Certification International Alliance (BCIA) housed within a CACREP-accredited graduate counseling department. It is also one of 4 accredited university-based programs and the only public university-based program.\\n\\nCurriculum\\n\\nThe curriculum for the neurofeedback program is based on the certification guidelines of the Biofeedback Certification International Alliance (bcia.org) and includes both didactic coursework and practicum experience. The introduction course covers the BCIA \"blueprint of knowledge\" components and also introduces students to hands-on experience of doing neurofeedback. Additional practicums through the Sarabia Family Counseling Center on the Downtown Campus provide opportunities to complete the required hours of clinical practice. Practicum experience can be incorporated into counseling internship courses. Additional advanced courses cover more sophisticated forms of Neurotherapy, such as Quantitative EEG (QEEG), QEEG-guided NFB, Z-score NFB, Z-score LORETA NFB, Slow Cortical Potential (SCP) training, and the use of Event-Related Potentials (ERP) in assessment. In addition, training incorporates various modalities of biofeedback into Neurotherapy, such as skin temperature, skin conductance, respiration, heart-rate variability, and electromyogram (EMG).\\nA constantly growing body of research is showing that neurofeedback (NFB) provides clinical benefit for several mental health issues, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD/ADD), anxiety, trauma, depression, emotional regulation, addiction, and stress. The neurofeedback training program at UTSA is designed to prepare clinicians to provide competent and effective treatment for a wide variety of issues using many of the most popular systems available on the market today. The UTSA Neurofeedback Program is unique as it is one of only four BCIA accredited university-based programs in the world.

We are currently studying the ways that NFB helps with anxiety-related disorders and PTSD. In addition, doctoral dissertation projects are researching ways that neurofeedback may be integrated efficiently into counseling graduate programs, attending to counselor burnout, and reducing alcohol cravings. The addition of a 38-channel EEG system, using Event-Related Potential assessments, will bolster our research capacities going forward.\\nGregory, J. C., Romero, D. E., & Jones, M. S. (2020).

       "  Document(metadata={'source': '../data/crawled_content/utsa_edu_3000.txt'}, page_content='LINK: https://education.utsa.edu/counseling/bilingual-counseling-certifcate.html\\nTITLE: Bilingual Counseling Certificate | College of Education and Human Development | UTSA | University of Texas at San Antonio\\nCONTENT:\\n\\nBilingual Counseling Certificate\\n\\nÂ /Â\\nBilingual counselors are highly sought in counseling agencies, school districts, and counselor education programs.\\nThis 12-hour Bilingual Counseling Certificate is designed to meet the needs of students interested in developing foundational skills in bilingual counseling with an emphasis on Spanish.\\nThe Bilingual Counseling Certificate is offered through the Department of Counseling (COU) with support from the Department of Bicultural and Bilingual Studies (BBL). Both departments reside in the College of Education and Human Development. The Department of Counseling bears ultimate responsibility for the certification program.\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAssociate Professor\\nCounseling\\nPrograms\\nResources\\nTraining\\n\\nWhy Pursue a Bilingual Counseling Certificate\\n\\nUTSA is one of only ten CACREP-accredited programs offering a bilingual counseling certificate. The certificate is available for students enrolled in:\\n- M.S. Clinical Mental Health Counseling\\n- M.Ed. School Counseling\\n- Ph.D. in Counselor Education and Supervision\\n\\nAbout the Program\\n\\n\\nAbout the Certificate in Bilingual Counseling\\n\\nAs of July 2019, the Latino/Hispanic/Latinx community was the largest ethnic group in the country with over 60 million people or 18.5% of the nation’s total population. The latest U.S. Census reported that over 41.5 million individuals over 5 years of age spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most prevalent spoken language in the United States. Moreover, San Antonio is a city with an overall 64% of inhabitants that identify as Latino/Hispanic. Thus, the local population of Spanish-speaking clients is high and deserves particular attention to their cultural and linguistic service needs.\\nThis certificate aims to address this dilemma by meeting the growing need for improved bilingual counselor education. The certificate coursework provides students with a strong linguistic background in Spanish and forwards opportunities to learn about cultural factors impacting the Latino/Hispanic culture. Additionally, the certificate focuses on improving language skills and targets opportunities to apply this learning to relevant counseling contexts via supervised counseling experience with Spanish-speaking clients\\nOver thirty-seven bilingual certificates or concentrations exist in mental health fields such as psychology, school psychology, social work, marriage, family therapy, school counseling, and clinical mental health across the United States. Approximately 10 (including ours) counseling programs accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) offer a bilingual counseling certificate to train both school and clinical mental health counselors in the nation.\\n\\nThe certificate consists of four courses:\\n\\n\\nOur History\\n\\nAs a Hispanic Thriving Institution, the faculty and students in the Department of Counseling at UTSA recognized the need for more specialized training for Spanish-speaking counselors in training. Historically, counselor preparation programs did not provide specialized training for bilingual counseling students. Instead, it was assumed that if they spoke Spanish they would be able to perform their counseling duties with the same effectiveness in Spanish. For many years, the Department of Counseling recognized the need for specialized training, leading to the development of study abroad programs and bilingual training and supervision. These efforts culminated in 2015 when Drs. Robertson, Trepal, and Zambrano developed the 12-hour Bilingual Counseling Certificate program. The certificate program received tremendous support from school and community organizations, obtaining approval from the university in 2016.\\nSince its creation, a total of 78 students have completed the Certificate in Bilingual Counseling, while 70 clinical mental and school counseling students are currently enrolled. Four alumni have entered doctoral programs to become bilingual counselor educators and supervisors. Doctoral students involved with the BCC are now working as counselor educators in institutions across Texas.\\n\\nPublications on Bilingual Counseling\\n\\nInteriano-\\nShiverdecker\\n, C.

PEP expands these efforts through the inclusion of behavioral health trainees from three additional disciplines, diversified clinical sites, and extensive interprofessional education.\\nIn 2021, the Department of Counseling was awarded an additional $1.6 million to continue expanding efforts to train counselors, social workers, school counselors, and psychologists for an additional 4 years.\\nPrograms\\nResources\\n\\nPITCH at UTSA recently awarded HRSA Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training Grant\\n\\nThe four-year interdisciplinary project is funded by a $1.6 million grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration. This partnership will guide close to 100 students from additional disciplines to provide real-time services in the local region.\\n\\nTraining Program\\n\\nPITCH Expanded Providers (PEP) includes behavioral health trainees from four disciplines: clinical mental health counseling (CMHC), school counseling (SC), social work (SW), and clinical psychology (PSY). All trainees complete didactic and clinical training focused on serving adults, children, adolescents, and transition-aged youth. Additionally, all PEP trainees participate in ongoing interprofessional education workshops.\\nAdditional training details by track are provided below:\\nTwelve CMHC PEP trainees are selected through a competitive recruitment process each year.

Jones\\nAdjunct Professor and Director Neurofeedback Program\\nCounseling\\nPrograms\\nResources\\n\\nA Certified Neurofeedback U.S. Training Center\\n\\nThe Neurofeedback training program is one of only 4 accredited university-based programs and the only public university-based program! Read the program\\'s goals, purpose, and what makes it such a unique opportunity for graduate students on UTSA Today.\\n\\nCurriculum\\n\\nThe curriculum for the neurofeedback program is based on the certification guidelines of the Biofeedback Certification International Alliance (bcia.org) and includes both didactic coursework and practicum experience. The introduction course covers the BCIA \"blueprint of knowledge\" components and also introduces students to hands-on experience of doing neurofeedback. Additional practicums through the Sarabia Family Counseling Center on the Downtown Campus provide opportunities to complete the required hours of clinical practice. Practicum experience can be incorporated into counseling internship courses. Additional advanced courses cover more sophisticated forms of Neurotherapy, such as Quantitative EEG (QEEG), QEEG-guided NFB, Z-score NFB, Z-score LORETA NFB, Slow Cortical Potential (SCP) training, and the use of Event-Related Potentials (ERP) in assessment. In addition, training incorporates various modalities of biofeedback into Neurotherapy, such as skin temperature, skin conductance, respiration, heart-rate variability, and electromyogram (EMG).\\n\\nCosts\\n\\nWhen compared to the fees for vendor-based training, the tuition-based program at UTSA is very competitive and offers far greater depth and more personalized supervision.\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nWe have published studies on the ways that NFB helps with anxiety-related disorders and PTSD, including first responders. In addition, doctoral dissertation projects have researched specific ways that neurofeedback is helpful for counselor burnout and reducing alcohol cravings. The addition of a 38-channel EEG system, using Event-Related Potential assessments, will bolster our research capacities going forward on ways that the brains of anxious and traumatized individuals process information, with the goal of developing more effective neurofeedback approaches for these populations. An international collaborative has been formed using database servers with analytical tools hosted by the UTSA neurofeedback program to refine neurofeedback approaches to a wide range of conditions.\\n\\nAbout Dr. Mark S. Jones\\n\\nDr. Jones has been a neurofeedback practitioner since 2002. He is board-certified in neurofeedback by the Biofeedback Certification International Alliance (BCIA) and certified in Quantitative EEG (Diplomate) by the QEEG Certification Board. He is a Licensed Professional Counselor (supervisor) and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (supervisor). He has a practice that incorporates neurofeedback treatment, the Well Mind Center (wellmindsa.com). He was previously the president of the International Society for Neuroregulation and Research (isnr.org), past president of the Biofeedback Society of Texas, and a Full Member of the Rice University/Texas Medical Center Chapter of Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society.\\n\\nAbout the Department of Counseling\\n\\nFind out more about UTSA COEHD Counseling Department.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- Main Building\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nStay Connected to the College of Education and Human Development\\n\\n\\nMission\\n\\nCOEHD will be an international model for developing inclusive, transformative leaders guided by principles of community, integrity, excellence, scholarship and service.

The statement is submitted on line and should be 500-750 words long.\\nThe Statement of Purpose is used by the Graduate Advisory Committee to assess two dimensions of your suitability for the master’s program in the Department of Communication. First, the committee uses the Statement of Purpose to assess your ability to articulate an argument using clear and concise language, with a definite thesis, well-illustrated supporting points, and a coherent overall message. Second, the committee uses the Statement of Purpose to assess the degree to which your academic or career goals (along with your understanding of the program) match the characteristics of the master’s program and the expertise of the graduate faculty. Beyond this, you should see the Statement of Purpose as your opportunity to persuade the selection committee that your background and interests are well-matched to the curriculum we offer, and that you are ready to engage the challenges and expectations of a graduate-level program.\\nYou should prepare to write your Statement of Purpose by carefully studying the available materials about the Department of Communication, the master’s program, and the graduate faculty. Consider which aspects of your background prepare you for entering our graduate program. Your Statement of Purpose provides an opportunity for you to describe aspects of your background that may not be evident from other application materials and how these aspects relate specifically to your desire to complete a master’s degree in Communication.\\nFaculty\\nStudents\\nInternships\\n\\nLinks\\n\\nThe following links can provide more information about writing an application essay.\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nStay Connected to the College of Liberal and Fine Arts\\n\\n\\nVision\\n\\nUTSA's College of Liberal and Fine Arts will become an internationally recognized college providing the core intellectual experience that prepares students for their role as responsible citizens in a free society.\\n\\nMission\\n\\nThe College of Liberal and Fine Arts will meet the needs of the diverse population of Texas through quality research and creative work, exemplary teaching, and professional contributions to the community.\\nBack to Top\"),\n",

He majored in Advertising with a minor in Psychology. He received his M.A. in Media Studies from the same College at Penn State. He received his Ph.D. in Communication from the Department of Communication at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\\nHis primary research interest deals with the social-psychological effects of playing video games. A growing literature in this area has demonstrated a link between violent video game play and aggression. His work has focused on going beyond this general link in three ways: (1) examining several important interaction variables in the game play context (e.g., frustration, expertise, etc.), (2) exploring how narrative involvement (i.e., getting wrapped-up in a game\\'s storyline) influences the effects of violence, and (3) determining when non-aggressive outcomes, even cathartic relief of anger, are possible.\\nDr. Mahood has published peer-reviewed articles in several journals, including the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Mass Communication & Society, Health Communication, the Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising, and Sex Roles. Dr Mahood has also had several competitively-selected conference papers accepted by the International Communication Association, the National Communication Association, and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.\\nPrior to his current position at UTSA, Dr. Chad Mahood was an Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University (2006 – 2011).

       "  Document(metadata={'source': '../data/crawled_content/utsa_edu_3000.txt'}, page_content=\"LINK: https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/research/index.html\\nTITLE: CS Research | College of Sciences | UTSA | University of Texas at San Antonio\\nCONTENT:\\n\\nComputer Science Research\\n\\nÂ /Â\\nFaculty research in the Department of Computer Science can be broadly categorized into five cross-cutting thrusts:\\n- Computing Foundations and Emerging Technologies\\n- Cybersecurity and Privacy\\n- Data-Driven Intelligence\\n- Networked Computer Systems\\n- Software Systems\\nOur research is supported by more than $5 million in active research grants and contracts from various external funding agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, National Security Agency, Army Research Office, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Office of Naval Research, and Department of Homeland Security.\\nThe strength of the department’s research is also evidenced in part by nine home-grown NSF CAREER awardees. Among the nine UTSA degree programs recognized in the 2019 Times Higher Education World University Rankings by subject, UTSA’s highest program ranking belonged to Computer Science at 60 in the nation and among the top 250 in the world. The Computer Science research program continues to move up in world ranking: NTU ranking placed it at 108 in 2021 and NSF’s FY20 HERD survey placed the UTSA Computer Science department at the national rank of 57 in R&D expenditures, just below UC Berkeley, and above UT Dallas, Rice, Duke, and Rutgers.\\nComputer Science faculty and its affiliated research entities (Institute for Cyber Security, Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security, AI Matrix Consortium, and Open Cloud Institute) have fostered and maintained close ties with research and education partners both inside and outside of UTSA.\\nPrograms\\nFaculty & Staff\\nResearch\\nStudents\\nEvents & Newsletters\\n\\nResearch Areas\\n\\nComputers are powerful problem-solving devices, but they are not infinitely powerful. As computational power improves over time, we are faced with computational challenges that are growing in both size and complexity. To face these growing challenges, researchers must determine which challenges have solutions that can be computed efficiently and which tasks cannot be computed efficiently.\\nAnswers to these questions can change over time as new technologies are developed in hardware (e.g., quantum and cloud computing) and software (e.g., programming languages and compilers). Researchers in the department approach these critical needs along several fronts such as algorithms, quantum computing, computer architecture, cloud computing, and parallel and distributed systems.\\nParticipating Faculty\\nCybersecurity has become a national imperative over the last decade. The number of cyberattacks has increased across all sectors both within the U.S. as well as the world in general. Some estimates place the expected annual cost of cybercrime to exceed $10 trillion by 2025. Given this, the importance of conducting research in various areas of cybersecurity to improve the cybersecurity posture of organizations and nations has increased in importance.\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has identified five core functions organizations need to concentrate on in their cybersecurity programs: 1) Identify, 2) Protect, 3) Detect, 4) Respond, and 5) Recover. Each of these core functions provides a rich area for research to improve cybersecurity. Additionally, the introduction of any advances in technology also introduces new cybersecurity concerns. In the last two decades we have seen cybersecurity issues in areas such as cloud computing, wireless networks, autonomous vehicles, cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\nThe volumes of data produced by humans and machines today significantly outpace humans' ability to absorb, evaluate, and make complicated decisions based on that data. Artificial intelligence/machine learning is the foundation of all computer learning and the future of all complex real-world decision-making under uncertainty.\\nOur research covers a wide range of topics of this fast-evolving field, advancing how machines reason, learn, predict, plan, and control, while also making them secure, robust and trustworthy. Research covers both the theory and applications of data driven intelligence. This broad area studies artificial intelligence/machine learning theory (such as algorithms and optimization), big data (data management, computation, and analysis), statistical learning (such as inference, graphical models, and causal analysis), deep learning (such as adversarial learning, explainability, and knowledge representation), reinforcement learning, symbolic reasoning, as well as diverse hardware implementations of machine learning.\\nNetworked computer systems, from embedded and mobile devices to large-scale high-performance computers, data centers, and cloud computing, have become the backbone of our society’s IT infrastructure, supporting public services, business, scientific innovation, healthcare, and education. The wide application of networked computer systems has made the research on their design, management, optimization, and applications important research areas.\\nUTSA's Computer Science faculty have a long history of conducting high-impact and innovative research in such systems. Their research involved the fundamental system designs, hardware, algorithms, and optimizations for low-power embedded and IoT devices, parallel, distributed and high-performance computing, cloud computing and data centers, and computer networks. Their research also involves systems support for a wide range of applications, such as web services, AI, big data, healthcare, earth science, virtual/augmented reality, robotics, security, and privacy.\\nSoftware systems deliver novel computing technologies such as algorithms, intelligence, and analytics, and connect them to the end users. The department's research on software systems covers a variety of research topics towards enhancing software productivity, quality, user experience, scalability, etc. These research projects develop:\\n- Novel features of programming languages and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to accelerate software development\\n- Formal methods, program analysis, and testing techniques to systematically reduce software defects and policy violations\\n- Human-computer interfaces based on emerging platforms such as mobile devices and virtual/augmented reality\\n- Scalable software systems over big data\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n\\nVision\\n\\nThe College of Sciences envisions itself as a leading institution of higher learning in sciences and mathematics, with local and global impact.\\nBack to Top\\n\\n\"),\n",

This report evaluates the implementation and impact of the Crime Plan from its inception through April 2024, with particular emphasis on Year 3 (May 2023-Apr 2024). It summarizes the methodology and results of an independent, empirical assessment of the implementation and impact of the near- and mid-term strategies over a three-year period since the Crime Plan began in May 2021. The Crime Plan consists of three primary strategies: hot spots policing, place network investigations, and focused deterrence. These strategies were purposely chosen for their strong evidence base, and they were intentionally layered to help reduce violent crime in Dallas over the short, mid, and longer terms. To date, hot spots policing (short-term strategy) and place network investigations (mid-term strategy) have been fully implemented, and their results and impact are detailed in this report. Focused deterrence (long-term strategy) began in June 2023 when DPD led a call-in session for high-risk violent offenders. A second call-in session took place in November 2023. This report also evaluates the implementation and impact of the focused deterrence strategy to date, including the challenges associated with mandating attendance at call-in sessions by individuals on probation or parole.\\nBeginning in July 2022, the Tacoma Police Department began executing a three-part strategic plan to reduce violent crime (hereafter referred to as the “Crime Plan”). As of July 2024, the first phase of the plan (hot spots policing) has been operational across the city for two years, and a commercial corridor between Puyallup Avenue and E. 25th Street is being treated under the problem-oriented, placed-based policing (POPBP) phase of the Crime Plan. The Crime Plan includes a short-term hot spots policing strategy, a mid-term POPBP strategy, and a longer-term focused deterrence strategy, which has not yet begun. These three strategies were purposely designed to work together to help reduce violent crime in the City of Tacoma by focusing on the relatively few places where violent crime is prevalent and the relatively few individuals responsible for committing it.\\nBeginning in January 2023, the San Antonio Police Department began executing a three-part strategic plan to reduce violent crime (hereafter referred to as the “Crime Plan”). As of January 2024, the first phase of the plan – hot spots policing – has been fully implemented, and the second phase – Problem-Oriented, Place-Based Policing (POPBP) is about to begin. The Crime Plan includes a short-term hot spots policing strategy, a mid-term POPBP strategy, and a longer-term focused deterrence strategy, which has not yet begun. These three strategies were purposely designed to work together to help reduce violent crime in San Antonio by focusing on the relatively few places where violent crime is prevalent and the relatively few individuals responsible for committing it.\\nBeginning in late September 2022, the Salt Lake City Police Department began executing a three-part strategic plan to reduce violent crime (hereafter referred to as the “Crime Plan”). As of September 2023, the first phase of the plan – hot spots policing – has been fully implemented, and the second phase is about to begin. The Crime Plan includes a short-term hot spots policing strategy, a mid-term problem-oriented, place-based policing strategy (POPBP), and a longer-term focused deterrence strategy, which has not yet begun.

As of July 2023, all three phases of the Crime Plan are being implemented. These include a short-term hot spots policing strategy, a mid-term place network investigations strategy (PNI), and most recently, a longer-term focused deterrence strategy, which began in June 2023. These three strategies were purposely designed to work together to help reduce violent crime in the City of Dallas by focusing on the relatively few places where violent crime is prevalent (hot spots) and the relatively few individuals responsible for committing it.\\nThis data brief reports findings from Wave I survey, with approximately 4,000 middle and high school teachers responding from among the 50 largest school districts across the U.S., which generate a comprehensive knowledge base about teacher victimization, and will be a resource for the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies to improve and enhance school safety, especially among teachers.\\nDelivered to the Dallas Police Department September 8, 2022\\nThere is a growing concern about violence toward and victimization of teachers across the United States, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing number of empirical studies on violence against teachers suggest a high prevalence of teacher victimization by students at schools and negative effects on victimized teachers. Despite these impressions, there is no nationwide empirical study investigating the prevalence/risk factors and negative consequences of teacher victimization and how schools respond to violence against teachers after resuming in-person classes across the nation. To address this gap, the present two-wave longitudinal research, funded by the National Institute of Justice, has been implemented to understand the prevalence and predictors of seven different types of victimization against teachers at schools, negative effects of teacher victimization, and school responses to teacher victimization among the 50 largest U.S. school districts. This data brief reports findings from Wave I survey, with approximately 4,000 middle and high school teachers responding from among the 50 largest school districts across the U.S., which generate a comprehensive knowledge base about teacher victimization, and will be a resource for the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies to improve and enhance school safety, especially among teachers.\\nThis project was supported by award number 2015-VV-BX-K020, and delivered to the National Institute of Justice, United States Department of Justice, June 17, 2022\\nThe purpose of this study was to better understand the various VTC program approaches, populations served, participant substance misuse and mental health needs, and basic program and participant outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive longitudinal multisite process, implementation, and short-term outcome evaluation. The study was designed to address four general research questions: (1) What are the structures of the VTC programs? (2) What are the policies and procedures of the VTC programs? (3) What populations are the VTCs serving? (4) What are the basic program and participant outcomes? Outcomes examined include graduation and termination rates, as well as recidivism in terms of self-reported arrests.\\nThis project was supported by award number 2017-BJ-CX-K055.\\nThis paper examines the role that the type of defense counsel plays in federal justice system outcomes. We begin with a background on federal indigent defense systems and a review of the prior research examining the impact of counsel type on sentencing. We then describe the study and present our descriptive results, which explore the frequency and variation in the use of each type of defense counsel (public defenders, assigned counsel, and private attorneys) and other key variables (disposition, incarceration decision, sentence length, year, district, case, and defendant characteristics). Next, we model the outcomes of incarceration and sentence length to test whether type of counsel significantly impacts these decisions after controlling for legal and extra-legal factors. Lastly, the results are summarized and situated in a broader understanding of the federal justice system.\\nDelivered to the Dallas Police Department February 8, 2022\\nAssessing Challenges, Needs, and Innovations of Gender-Based Violence Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic\\nThis survey was developed and distributed in collaboration with the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. The goal of this project was to document the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dynamics of gender-based violence in addition to the challenges, needs, and innovations that service providers experienced.\\nIn September 2019, researchers from the University of Texas at San Antonio and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville distributed an electronic survey to all Texas law enforcement agencies seeking information on their policies and procedures related to officer fitness and wellness. The overarching goal of the project was to learn more about how Texas law enforcement agencies are thinking about and responding from a policy perspective to contemporary perspectives on officer wellness. The results from the survey will allow agencies to benchmark their own wellness policies and programs against others in the state and to consider ways, where feasible, to invest in improving the fitness, wellness, and resiliency of their officers.\\nStudents\\n\\n22\\n\\nDegree programs\\n\\n147k+\\n\\nInternship hours\\n\\n4\\n\\nResearch centers\\n\\n$4.8M\\n\\nin grants awarded across 22 projects\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- Main Building 2.306\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n- 210-458-7900\\n\\nStay Connected to the College for Health, Community and Policy (HCAP)\\n\\n\\nMission\\n\\nThe mission of the College for Health, Community and Policy (HCAP) is to develop solutions to affect change for complex social issues to improve the well-being of communities and the world.

Students must perform at least 150 hours of service at an approved agency. All hours must be completed during the semester in which the student is enrolled in CRJ 4933. Please see the relevant academic calendar for semester start and end dates.\\nMay be repeated for credit in a subsequent semester at a separate agency, but no more than 6 semester credit hours will apply to a bachelor’s degree.\\n\\nImportant Internship Links\\n\\nNote: A criminal background check may be a requirement during the semesters in which a student enrolls in internships. It is the responsibility of the student to determine if his or her criminal history background will present a problem before applying for admission to the program. Students with problematic criminal history will not be able to complete most of the field-experiences that are required by the program.\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAssistant Professor of Practice, Internship Coordinator\\nCriminology and Criminal Justice\\nStudents\\n\\nInternship Coordinator Chris Booker explains the internship process\\n\\nA brief description of how to enroll in CRJ 4933, the criminal justice internship.\\nThe undergraduate internship program (CRJ 4933) is available to criminal justice majors who have 90 earned hours and have passed the following prerequisite classes:\\nAdditional prerequisites may apply to specific internship agencies. Consult the department’s Internship Coordinator for more information.\\nEarly coordination with the CJ Internship Coordinator and the selected agency is critical. Agencies often require an extended period of time to approve an internship application.\\nStudents must have an internship offer in place from an approved internship agency before registering for CRJ 4933.\\n\\nHow to enroll in the internship\\n\\n- If you don’t have an agency in mind, start by thinking about where you want to work when you graduate or the type of experience you want — law enforcement, probation, courts, private security.\\n- Once you have decided the type of agency, think about location – San Antonio, Boerne, Live Oak, etc.\\nWhat if I want to intern at an agency that is not on the list? If you wish to intern at an agency that is not on the directory, that agency will have to be approved by the Internship Coordinator, the Department of Criminology & Criminal Justice, and the provost of the university. There are extensive legal agreements that have to be reviewed and signed. This increases the amount of time it takes to approve your internship. Agencies must be willing to meet the learning objectives of CRJ 4933. They must be willing to assign meaningful duties to interns. They must also be criminal justice related agencies in the judgment of the internship coordinator. They must be willing to sign the legal agreements drafted by the UTSA Legal Affairs Office. Interning at an agency that you have a personal connection with is discouraged. When you graduate and enter the job market, you will have to contact agencies that you are unfamiliar with and inquire with them about how to seek employment. Going through this exercise now will better prepare you for that experience.\\n- An orientation\\n- Oral Interview\\n- Background Check\\n- Fingerprinting\\n- Psychological Screening\\n- Personality Index\\n- Resume\\n- Prerequisite Course\\n- The Internship Coordinator will inform you of the time and place of the next orientation meeting. During this meeting, the academic requirements and the final grade calculation of the internship will be explained, along with procedures for documenting internship hours. Students will receive a syllabus. At the conclusion of this meeting, you will be given a registration slip to take to advising. There will be several orientation meetings. If you cannot attend the first orientation offered due to a scheduling conflict, you can attend a later meeting.\\n- Take your registration slip to the Downtown Advising Office. Your advisor will register you for CRJ 4933. You do not need to make an appointment with your advisor to drop off your slip.\\nYou must complete 150 hours with your agency. All training sessions and agency orientations count toward the 150 hours. Driving from home to the agency and meal breaks will not be counted as internship hours. “On call” hours will not count towards the 150 hours unless you are actively responding to a call. Meet with your agency to establish your schedule; which days of the week you will work and what times. The schedule you arrange is between you and the agency as long as you reach 150 hours by the end of the semester.\\nThere are several required writing assignments for CRJ 4933. Requirements are listed in the course syllabus.\\nYour agency supervisor will complete an evaluation of your performance. The evaluation form will be available on Blackboard. It is the student’s responsibility to provide the evaluation form to their supervisor. The supervisor will complete the form and email it directly to the Internship Coordinator. The evaluation accounts for a significant portion of the student’s final grade.\\n\\n22\\n\\nDegree programs\\n\\n147k+\\n\\nInternship hours\\n\\n4\\n\\nResearch centers\\n\\n$4.8M\\n\\nin grants awarded across 22 projects\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- Main Building 2.306\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n- 210-458-7900\\n\\nStay Connected to the College for Health, Community and Policy (HCAP)\\n\\n\\nMission\\n\\nThe mission of the College for Health, Community and Policy (HCAP) is to develop solutions to affect change for complex social issues to improve the well-being of communities and the world.

Dr. Leonard accepted the offer and became responsible for developing a four year curriculum which would lead to a Bachelor’s Degree in Police Administration.\\nUpon his arrival at Washington State, Dr. Leonard began to realize how important it was that a Police Science Honorary be established. The purpose of this honorary would be to promote excellence in scholarship and performance. In January, 1942, Dr. Leonard met with seventeen Police Science majors at Washington state and Alpha Phi Sigma was established. Glenn Hill was elected as the first president and appointed a committee to draft the first Constitution and By-laws.\\nDuring its initial years Alpha Phi Sigma experienced only limited growth, but on March 24, 1976 in Dallas, Texas, the Executive Board of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences voted unanimously to designate Alpha Phi Sigma as the National Criminal Justice Honor Society. At this time, Alpha Phi Sigma had only fourteen chapters; however, since then, Alpha Phi Sigma has continued to grow and prosper at a very rapid rate and there are now over three hundred and sixty Chapters.\\nOver the years the National Officers have been located at Universities across the country, such as, Washington State University, Midwestern State University, Eastern Kentucky University, Texas Woman’s University, Fairmont State College, Marshall University, Tarleton State University, Florida International University, Boise State University, University of Houston ~ Downtown.\\n\\nRequirements of Alpha Phi Sigma\\n\\nAlpha Phi Sigma is the nationally recognized honor society for students in the Criminal Justice sciences. The society recognizes academic excellence by undergraduates as well as graduates of Criminal Justice.\\nTo become a member, the student must have completed one-third of their total hours required for graduation at his/her institution. The student must be recommended, to Nationals, by the chapter advisor.\\n\\nResources\\n\\n\\nCommunity\\n\\nIn December of 2022, APS delivered over $600 worth of toys through the generosity of UTSA students, faculty and staff.

Kalinec-Craig, Ph.D.\\n\\nÂ /Â\\nProfiles\\nAssociate Professor, Interdisciplinary Learning and Teaching\\n\\nContact\\n\\n\\nBio\\n\\nDr. Crystal Kalinec-Craig is an associate professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio in the department of Interdisciplinary Learning and Teaching in the College of Education and Human Development. She is a proud 5th generation south Texan who returned to serve her community. Her research trajectory has been profoundly shaped by esteemed mentors at the University of Arizona, who instilled in her a commitment to equity and justice in education. Drawing inspiration from scholars such as Drs. Erin Turner, Marcy Wood, and Marta Civil, her work centers on amplifying the voices of marginalized students in mathematics classrooms. Guided by concepts like Funds of Knowledge (pioneered by Dr. Luis Moll), Torres’ Rights of the Learner (theorized by Olga Torres), and rehumanizing mathematics for BIPOC students (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) with a sociopolitical lens (as theorized by Dr. Rochelle Gutiérrez at the University of Illinois), Dr. Kalinec-Craig strives to create inclusive learning environments that honor students' diverse experiences and knowledge. As a professor who prepares future elementary and middle grades teachers, she is proud of her responsibility. She openly shares the story that September 11, 2001, was her second day as a new 7th grade teacher, a moment that continues to influence who she is today. She has served as the program coordinator for the elementary education program, faculty senator, Vice President of Advocacy, Equity, and Research for the Association of Mathematics Teacher Education, and Graduate Advisor of Record for the department Ph.D. program. You can find her published work in journals such as Democracy and Education, Journal of Mathematical Behavior, Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education, ZDM, and NCTM's journal, Mathematics Teacher: Learning and Teaching. She lives with her partner, Scott, two dogs (a German Shepherd and rescue dog) and cat in San Antonio. You can find her on Instagram, Threads, Facebook, and TikTok.\\n\\nTeaching\\n\\nDr. Kalinec-Craig has experience as a former middle and high school mathematics teacher who taught in Arizona, Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Germany. As an associate professor at UTSA, her teaching expertise is in undergraduate elementary and middle grades mathematics methods.

Growing the company to over 350 employees nationwide, they successfully sold dNovusRDI in 2008. Today, they continue their work as entrepreneurs through FNK Ventures, LLC, a commercial real estate ownership and management company.\\nNancy, one of the first women to graduate from the United States Air Force Academy, is co-chair of UTSA’s Campaign Leadership Council and serves on the boards of the college’s Advisory Council and the Cyber & Analytics Advisory Board. Frank sits on the boards for the Catholic Community Foundation and the Catholic Fraternity Fund. Philanthropic leaders in the community, the Kudlas actively promote San Antonio’s considerable cybersecurity resources to leverage the city as a national leader in the cybersecurity industry and in the education of cybersecurity professionals, particularly women and minorities.\\nIn recognition of their support to the college’s cybersecurity programs, the Carlos Alvarez College of Business dedicated the Kudla Foundation Research Laboratory in their name in UTSA’s North Paseo Building.\\n\\nKudla Fellows\\n\\nDaniel Bringhurst\\nKendal Hasson\\nAnh Phan\\nEdward Dunn\\nFrom hardware reverse engineering to incident response, the exposure to different niches of cyber security has helped shape where I want to focus my career in the future. One aspect that has been rewarding in learning about the industry has been the mentorship program. I was given the opportunity to work with a mentor who is in a leadership position in the cyber field, and I got to spend time shadowing different teams in his cyber operations department.\\nOf the projects that I have been a part of, one the most exciting was setting up a honeypot network. I enjoyed the different aspects of learning how honeypots work, the networking behind honeypots and the malware that can affect them. This new subject area led to rabbit hole dives that resulted in new ideas and possibilities on how to setup the project honeypots.\\nJeff Knapp\\nJohn Newsom\\nThe most impactful research assignment required me to lead a team to build a new lab to study Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices as they relate to Building Automation Systems (BAS).

In particular, his research endeavors are focused on improving access to essential health commodities (e.g., contraceptives, antimalarials, HIV medication) in Low- and Middle-income Countries (LMICs). For individuals who are deprived of access to such essential health commodities, the consequences can be dire. For example, without reliable access to contraceptives, women may suffer unintended pregnancies, imposing economic and psychological burden, and adverse health outcomes including injuries, infections, and even deaths. HIV patients unable to obtain antiretrovirals may face delays in treatment initiation and interruptions during the treatment process, subsequently increasing the risk of viral resistance, treatment failure, and mortality.\\n\\nResearch Interests\\n\\n- Global Health\\n- Healthcare Supply Chains\\n- Socially Responsible Supply Chains\\n- Empirical Analysis\\n- Advanced Econometrics\\n- Predictive Analytics\\n\\nDegrees\\n\\n- Ph.D. University of Minnesota\\n- M.S.

The program offers master’s degrees in K-12 Educational Leadership and in Higher Education Administration. Our Ph.D. program has two emphases: K-12 Educational Leadership and Higher Education Administration. The program also offers state certification for principals and superintendents along with a graduate certificate in higher education administration. All our programs are based on a cohort model that fosters collaboration and relationship-building among students. Many of our cohorts were established in partnership with local school districts and institutions of higher education. These partnerships include Edgewood ISD, Northeast ISD, Northside ISD, San Antonio ISD, Southwest ISD, and the Alamo Colleges, to name a few. As a community-centered program, we are always open and welcome new opportunities to develop additional partnerships that seek to foster leadership development and advocacy-orientated social change. These partnerships reflect the commitment and dedication of our faculty members in delivering community-based and equity-focused learning opportunities.\\nNow more than ever, we need committed individuals who are passionate and will persevere and who employ an asset-based lens to solve our nation’s tribulations in the field of education. Given our departmental location in the heart of downtown San Antonio, the ELPS faculty has a clear focus on critical issues impacting urban and rural communities as many of our students have learned and/or taught in these spaces. For instance, our program’s Urban School Leader Collaborative (USLC) has been recognized as a highly exemplary educational leadership preparation program from the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA, 2013). Ultimately, the ELPS faculty are committed to excellence in teaching, research, and community service, as such they continue to publish their research in peer-reviewed educational journals, community-focused publications, and present at regional, national, and international conferences. Further, the ELPS faculty’s pedagogical approaches seek to draw connections between the historical, socio-political, and economic contexts that have shaped and continue to impact our education systems, research paradigms, theoretical frameworks, policies, and practices. The ELPS faculty also seeks to create classroom learning opportunities that promote critical reflection, discussion, and experiential learning opportunities. The ELPS faculty also works closely with students within our small classes to allow for one-on-one attention and mentoring.\\nThe ELPS students are active participants in the learning process. They understand and critique existing structures of power and the social order and their respective role in those systems, as well as work to be social change agent within their respective community. The ELPS students complete our academic programs ready to confront a multitude of educational issues across the PK-20 educational continuum by utilizing critical approaches. ELPS students are trained to develop critical solutions and participatory approaches that undergird advocacy to cultivate equity, agency, and critical capacity building towards justice. As such, our master’s and doctoral alumni are positively impacting the communities in which they work in a variety of roles from school principals to district superintendents, higher education administration, and university faculty.\\nHighest educational regards,\\nAbout\\nFaculty\\nBecome a\\n\\nRoadrunner\\n\\n- Main Building\\n- One UTSA Circle\\n- San Antonio, TX 78249\\n\\nStay Connected to the College of Education and Human Development\\n\\n\\nMission\\n\\nCOEHD will be an international model for developing inclusive, transformative leaders guided by principles of community, integrity, excellence, scholarship and service.
