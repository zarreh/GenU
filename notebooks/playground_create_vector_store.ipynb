After reviewing all information and materials submitted by the employee, the Approving Authority may affirm his/her original decision or grant the employee’s request.\n",
      "- If the Approving Authority affirms his/her original decision to deny approval or rescind a management plan, the employee may send the Approving Authority a written request asking that the decision be appealed. Within 10 business days of receiving this request, the Approving Authority will forward materials submitted by the employee and information relating to the Approving Authority’s decision to the Approving Authority’s supervisor.Â This supervisor will review the materials forwarded by the Approval Authority and within 10 business days make a final decision to grant the employee’s request, to affirm the Approval Authority’s decision, or take such other action as he/she determines is in the best interests of UTSA.\n",

The purchase may be made only if the cost is less than from any other known source.\n",
      "- A UTSA employee should not make personal investments that could reasonably be expected to create a substantial conflict between the employee’s private interest and the public interest. This means that a UTSA employee should not have a direct or indirect financial interest in a business that conflicts with interest of UTSA or that might influence how the employee does his/her job. Some financial interests may be so indirect or so minimal that they do not create conflicts of interest, such as ownership of a minimal amount of stock in a company or an investment in a publicly traded mutual fund in which the employee does not exercise discretion regarding the investment of the assets of the fund. Questions about whether a particular investment creates a conflict of interest should be directed to the UTSA’s Office of Legal Affairs.\n",
      "- A UTSA employee may not accept an honorarium for services he or she would not have been asked to provide but for his or her official status. For example, a UTSA employee may not accept a gift or payment for giving a speech if he or she would not have been asked to provide the speech but for his or her official position. However, a UTSA employee may accept meals, transportation, and lodging in connection with his or her services as long as the services are more than merely perfunctory or superficial. Also, he or she may accept a gift of up to $250.\n",

The definition of “student loan lender” is very broad and covers entities that may not traditionally be thought of as student loan lenders. Consult UTSA’s Office of Legal Affairs to determine if the proposed gift from the student loan lender is permissible under the Texas Higher Education Fair Lending Practices Agreement. It is important to remember that even though the acceptance of a gift may not constitute a crime, it may appear to the public that a gift has influenced the employee in performing his or her job. Employees should not accept any gift that could appear to influence official conduct, even if the gift is technically legal.\n",

      "- If an approval required under this policy is denied or an approval or management plan is rescinded, the employee may request that the Approving Authority reconsider the decision by providing an explanation in writing and submitting any documentation in support of his/her request. After reviewing all information and materials submitted by the employee, the Approving Authority may affirm his/her original decision or grant the employee’s request.\n",
      "- If the Approving Authority affirms his/her original decision to deny approval or rescind a management plan, the employee may send the Approving Authority a written request asking that the decision be appealed. Within 10 business days of receiving this request, the Approving Authority will forward materials submitted by the employee and information relating to the Approving Authority’s decision to the Approving Authority’s supervisor.Â This supervisor will review the materials forwarded by the Approval Authority and within 10 business days make a final decision to grant the employee’s request, to affirm the Approval Authority’s decision, or take such other action as he/she determines is in the best interests of UTSA.\n",

The purchase may be made only if the cost is less than from any other known source.\n",
      "- A UTSA employee should not make personal investments that could reasonably be expected to create a substantial conflict between the employee’s private interest and the public interest. This means that a UTSA employee should not have a direct or indirect financial interest in a business that conflicts with interest of UTSA or that might influence how the employee does his/her job. Some financial interests may be so indirect or so minimal that they do not create conflicts of interest, such as ownership of a minimal amount of stock in a company or an investment in a publicly traded mutual fund in which the employee does not exercise discretion regarding the investment of the assets of the fund. Questions about whether a particular investment creates a conflict of interest should be directed to the UTSA’s Office of Legal Affairs.\n",
      "- A UTSA employee may not accept an honorarium for services he or she would not have been asked to provide but for his or her official status. For example, a UTSA employee may not accept a gift or payment for giving a speech if he or she would not have been asked to provide the speech but for his or her official position. However, a UTSA employee may accept meals, transportation, and lodging in connection with his or her services as long as the services are more than merely perfunctory or superficial. Also, he or she may accept a gift of up to $250.\n",
      "- non-cash items worth less than $250;\n",
      "- Noncompliance with this policy may subject a UTSA employee to discipline in accordance with applicable procedures up to and including termination of employment. Additionally, civil and criminal penalties may apply under certain circumstances.\n",

      "The UTSA Hazardous Waste Management Program is administered by Laboratory Safety and Compliance LS&C. Each member of the University community, however, is responsible for the proper management of hazardous materials or wastes used or generated by that individual. This responsibility includes compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including proper identification and labeling of all hazardous materials and guidelines and procedures established by LS&C.\n",
      "UTSA encourages each member of the University community to have a positive attitude toward proper hazardous waste management and a commitment to waste reduction. Commitment by the University community to these goals can greatly reduce escalating hazardous waste disposal costs and ensure compliance with applicable laws.\n",
      "UTSA has applied for and received an identification number from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) identifying UTSA as a hazardous waste generator. UTSA is a generator of Hazardous Waste as defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). UTSA is subject to regulations applicable to non-industrial large quantity generators.\n",
      "The primary federal law governing the management of hazardous waste is the RCRA. Regulations implementing RCRA are promulgated and enforced by EPA. The primary state law governing the management of hazardous waste is the Solid Waste Disposal Act, found in the Health and Safety Code. Regulations implementing the Solid Waste Disposal Act are promulgated and enforced by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)\n",
      "This University program must comply with all the \"General Facility Standards\" including accumulation time; general waste analysis; security; general inspection requirements; personnel training; contingency and emergency procedures; record keeping and reporting requirements, and use and management of containers.\n",

      "Federal regulations promulgated and enforced by the Department of Commerce, Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the Department of State, International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), prohibit the unlicensed export of specific technologies for reasons of national security or protection of trade. If University research involves such specified technologies, the EAR and/or ITAR may require the University to obtain prior approval from State or Commerce before allowing foreign nationals to participate in the research, partnering with a foreign company and/or sharing research – verbally or in writing – with persons who are not United States citizens or permanent resident aliens.\n",
      "Export control regulations have the potential to harm the quality of University research, undermine publication rights, and prohibit international collaboration if the dissemination of University research is not placed in the public domain and does not qualify for the fundamental research exclusion. The consequences of violating these regulations can be quite severe, ranging from loss of research contracts to monetary penalties to jail time for the individual violating these regulations.\n",
      "The Office of Sponsored Project Administration and Principal Investigator should conduct a thorough review of research projects and contract provisions to determine whether and, if so how, a particular research project is impacted by export control regulations.\n",
      "Principal Investigators/Researchers have the following responsibilities:\n",
      "- Prior to commencing any research, to review and cooperate with the Office of Sponsored Project Administration, Office of Contracts and Industry Agreements and/or Office of Research Integrity to determine whether their research is impacted by the controls or requirements contained within export regulations\n",
      "- To re-evaluate that determination before changing the scope or adding new staff to the project to determine if such changes alter the initial determination\n",
      "- To make export determinations far enough in advance to obtain an authorization, should one be required.\n",
      "Principal Investigators, faculty, and staff should not automatically assume that the fundamental research exclusion, public domain exclusion and/or educational exclusion apply to their project. The Office of Research Integrity will assist researchers in assessing the application of such regulations, but primary compliance responsibility rests with the researcher.\n",

      "The Office of Research Integrity assists the Affected Party / Researcher in setting up the security measures and protocols needed to ensure compliance with export and sanction regulations through the establishment of a Technology Control Plan (TCP).\n",
      "A TCP is used to determine the export control classification, restrictions on release of information, physical and information security measures, and other security measures necessary to safeguard and control access to information or items that are export restricted.\n",
      "It is the responsibility of the Affected Party / Researcher to manage and enforce compliance within the terms of the TCP. ORI assists with the development and determine whether or not it is sufficient to adequately protect the item and information for unauthorized access and export (deemed export). TCPs will include:\n",
      "- A commitment to export control compliance;\n",
      "- Identification of the applicable export controls and items or technologies subject to the controls;\n",
      "- A description of the agreed upon security measures to control the item / technology;\n",

If the Student fails to appear without good cause, as determined by Student Conduct and Community Standards, the latter may bar or cancel the Student’s enrollment or otherwise alter the status of the Student until the Student complies with the summons, or it may proceed to implement the disciplinary hearing procedures provided in Section 501, et seq of this Policy.

If Interim Disciplinary Action is imposed prior to the Respondent having an opportunity to respond to the allegation(s) or to the concern of any potential threat, the University will provide the Respondent an opportunity to respond to the allegation(s) and potential threat as soon as practicable after instituting the Interim Disciplinary Action. Following this opportunity to respond to the allegation(s) and any potential threat, the Dean may remove the Interim Disciplinary Action if warranted. If removal of the Interim Disciplinary Action is not warranted, the Respondent will have an accelerated hearing unless the Respondent agrees to an Administrative Disposition.

      "- Be enrolled full time in the semester for which your reinstatement is filed\n",
      "- Circumstances beyond your control\n",
      "- Failure to apply in a timely fashion for a reduced course load authorization from International Student Services\n",
      "- The violation did not occur more than five months ago from the date of reinstatement application\n",
      "- You have not engaged in unauthorized employment\n",
      "\n",
      "When to Apply\n",
      "\n",
      "It is your best interest to file the petition for reinstatement immediately after the violation and within 5 months of termination. USCIS processing times are highly variable and approval of a reinstatement of F-1 status can take 6 months or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Procedures\n",
      "\n",
      "- I-539 application fee: check or money order for $370 and a biometrics fee of $85 payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n",
      "- A letter requesting reinstatement to F-1 status and explaining the circumstances. The letter must include the following four points with as much detail as possible:\n",
      "- The reason for being out of status (failing to maintain full time student status)\n",
      "- That the violation resulted from circumstances beyond your control or failure to apply in a timely fashion for a reduced course load authorization\n",

      "- That you are currently enrolled as a full time student and that you intend to pursue a full course of study in the next semester\n",
      "- That you are not deportable on any other grounds (such as conviction of crime)\n",
      "- A photocopy of your previous Form(s) I-20\n",
      "- Copy of the passport identity page with the expiration date\n",

      "International Student Services recommends students copy their application materials to keep as for their own records before sending the documents to USCIS.\n",
      "If the request for reinstatement is approved, the USCIS officer will stamp the Form I-20 to indicate that the student has been reinstated and return the Form I-20 to the student. Once the reinstatement is approved, the student is once again eligible for the benefits of F-1 status. If the application is denied, you will be notified to leave the United States.\n",
      "If approved, you must request an updated I-20 and start maintaining your F-1 status immediately. If denied, you must depart the United States immediately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Special Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing times for reinstatement applications vary. However, it may take up to 12 months for the application to be adjudicated. Although the student may continue studying while the application is pending, he or she will not be eligible for any type of employment until the reinstatement is approved and will not be able to travel.\n",
      "If the student decides to choose the option of traveling back to the home country to regain F-1 visa status, he or she will receive a new I-20 for “Initial Attendance” with a new SEVIS number. This new I-20 will be used to re-enter the United States. If the student chooses to travel to regain status, he or she will forfeit the accrued time toward practical training eligibility. F-1 students will need to be registered for one academic year in order to qualify for practical training.\n",

With so many options with UTSA –led programs and our international partners, this is easy to do with some planning.\n",
      "Throughout the process, we will be here for you to ensure you are on track for your trip.\n",
      "To obtain approval for course credit abroad your courses need to be approved by your department and college. See your Academic Advisor to begin the approval process for your program of study.\n",
      "For all programs in which you receive a foreign transcript, courses will be transferred with the grade that was earned. If the credit is issued by the U.S. Institution of Record the courses will also be transferred with the grade that was earned.\n",
      "Your grades are averaged into your GPA, but not to your UTSA GPA.\n",
      "The process is the same for graduate students as undergraduates. Graduate students will have the transcript sent to the UTSA Graduate School to have their credits recorded.\n",

Archaeology invokes all of these notions – especially when one envisions herself tromping through the jungle in search of new ruins some 1,500 years old. My time in Mexico and Belize are invaluable to me and have made me more aware as a researcher and a person. Beginning international travel can be daunting but UTSA’s study abroad experience gives students a venue in which to explore where they wouldn’t, challenge their assumptions, and grow as a globally-aware citizen.”\n",

I learned all about Taiwan’s indigenous people, concepts of different types of scenery, ideas behind traditional Tai Chi, calligraphy and even how to make boba milk tea. I hope to later revisit Taiwan and teach English as a second language for Chinese students! While we did our day tours it was amazing to finally be in the locations that I was only able to ever see through a computer screen. I felt so happy being able to be somewhere that wasn’t home for once. The ability to also be so immersed in another culture then the one I grew up in was amazing.\"\n",

Experiencing almost everything I had only learned about in classrooms in person, was such an immersive education that I never could have imagined. I traveled to 11 countries and went from learning about the slave trade and music in Ghana, to walking through the Elmina Castle, where they were kept until they were transported on the middle passage, and partaking in Ghanaian dances and drumming circles. The whole voyage shaped how I view education and how one should look at the world. I truly found myself and my passions while on this study abroad. Everyone I met was kind and willing to lend a helping hand and support whenever needed. I have made lifelong friends that live all over the world and despite us being from different backgrounds, we have this journey in common and so many other things despite coming from different places.”\n",

One of my favorite memories from the trip was getting to visit a temple in Jaipur and participate in a prayer because I felt connected to the culture and engaged with the community there. Observing locals and staying curious really helped me integrate myself while abroad. My advice to anyone who is studying abroad would be to accept the ambiguity and what you do not know. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and keep an open mind going into the experience!\"\n",

Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new and meet someone of a different background, as there are many foreigners there. One of the most important things I learned abroad was the importance of speaking multiple languages - most locals in Hong Kong speak at least three different languages.

Although PR is in the US, there was a sharp contrast from what I expected of a US territory to what I witnessed. Very importantly though, my experience helped me redefine quality service as an act and habit that goes far beyond just volunteerism. Additionally, as a result of my trip, I recognized how I can be a better active citizen and advocate in my community.

The 600-plus acre campus is surrounded by a thriving Medical Center, USAA, Valero, Fiesta Texas and anchor retail facilities such as The Shops at La Cantera and The Rim.\n",
      "The Downtown Campus is located between San Antonio's historic West Side neighborhood and the downtown core in close proximity to a number of cultural, historic and commercial venues. The campus is home to the Margie and Bill Klesse College of Engineering and Integrated Design, the College for Health, Community, and Policy and the College of Education and Human Development. Also based at the Downtown Campus is the Urban Education Institute, a hub to prepare future educators, strengthen community partnerships and raise the educational attainment levels and earnings of economically disadvantaged students, as well as UTSA School of Data Science which is housed in San Pedro I, a building whose name recognizes the university's commitment to the site as a historic and future hub of prosperity for the city.\n",
      "The Southwest Campus is located on the San Antonio River in downtown San Antonio, on the historical site of the Southwest School of Art, which merged with UTSA in 2022. Southwest School of Art was founded in 1965 and has long been regarded as a nationally recognized leader in visual arts education. An urban oasis, the campus has been a place for learning and growth for more than 165 years. The buildings and campus were originally known as the Ursuline Convent and Academy, which opened in 1851 as the first school for girls in San Antonio.\n",
      "The Hemisfair Campus is situated east of the Downtown Campus, along IH-37 opposite the Alamodome. UTSA is proud to have been entrusted with the stewardship of the property since 1973. The Hemisfair land was home to the 1968 World's Fair. Today, the Hemisfair Campus is located adjacent to the Tower of the Americas and the redevelopment of Hemisfair including restaurants, parks and residential housing in the downtown core of San Antonio.\n",
      "Athletics enrich the UTSA experience, encouraging a sense of community and school spirit that inspires students, faculty, staff, alumni and fans alike.

Most federal application forms can be completed directly in CAYUSE. Non-federal application forms are uploaded to CAYUSE for internal routing and approval.\n",
      "- Complete an Electronic Proposal Routing Form and upload it to CAYUSE to enter your proposal into the UTSA routing system.\n",
      "- Once all administrative forms have been completed and the budget has been finalized, the PI can begin routing the proposal electronically for Departmental and College approvals.\n",
      "- To allow time for a thorough review, it is recommended that the final complete proposal be sent to the college research concierge team no less than 2 business days before the submission deadline. The team will review the proposal and the funding agency guidelines to make sure all proposal documents are completed and send needed corrections to the PI before submission.\n",

      "Following a three-month paid internship at the Autism Treatment Center, Miranda continued her training at Little Spurs Autism Centers, which cater to children with ASD. Here, she found her calling. “I get to teach kids while we are playing, so they are having fun while learning,” she said.\n",
      "Overcoming her fear of public speaking, Miranda won second place and formed a heartwarming connection. “A mother came up to me and told me that she was so appreciative of the work I and others are doing for those with ASD, and that her three-year-old son had just recently said the word “Mama” for the first time,” she said. “We both ended up crying happy tears.”\n",

To excel in professional growth, she then pursued graduate studies and earned a master’s degree in economics. While in her program, Maren actively participated in coursework and networked with faculty. “Engage deeply with your coursework and reach out to your professors. These relationships and the knowledge gained are invaluable,” she said.\n",
      "Originally from Melsbach, Germany, Maren began her UTSA journey in 2019 on a track scholarship. As a dedicated member and captain of the UTSA track team, Maren found her second family among her teammates. Her commitment reached a proud pinnacle in the summer of 2022 when she secured second place in the heptathlon at a conference meet. “Those moments on the track, pushing your limits, they teach you resilience. They mirror the challenges you face academically,” Maren said.\n",

Not only does her involvement on campus improve her college life, but it also prepares for the future, too.\n",

      "Lance, a San Antonio native, came to UTSA expecting to transfer to UT Austin as a student of the Coordinated Admission Program (CAP) but found himself pleasantly surprised by the university.\n",
      "“I fell in love with the school the first two years I was here,” Lance says.\n",
      "The short 15 minute commute to the Main Campus and the potential to save money didn’t hurt, either, so he elected to continue his degree at UTSA.\n",
      "Lance’s major is a fairly uncommon one. What is an actuary? Actuarial science is the study of the financial implications of uncertain future events. Actuaries use math and statistics to assess risk in the fields of life and health insurance, pensions, employee benefits, and investments. Actuaries need excellent quantitative reasoning skills and an understanding of modern business and finance. As Lance describes it: “An actuary can become a finance person, but a finance person cannot be an actuary.”\n",
      "Although looking forward to his career as an actuary, Lance plans to work as a flight attendant after graduation for a couple years before going into his career. “I want to travel the world, and it seems like a very cost-effective plan,” he says.\n",
      "Outside of his coursework, Lance has taken the time to make connections and get involved on campus. He’s currently the Service Director of the Vietnamese Student Association. “I’m actually not Vietnamese. I’m Chinese and Filipino,” he states, but the organization has been beneficial for him nonetheless. He goes on to say that his high school lacked a predominant Asian community for him to connect with, and UTSA’s diversity allowed him to find that. “Coming to college, it was nice just know that there’s other people [that are] Asian like me, and I’m able to make those friends and connections,” he says.\n",
      "Lance advises future students not to underestimate the size of UTSA. “It’s actually bigger than I expected,” he states. “There’s all these cool resources, and it’s more like a little community…it’s basically its own little city.”\n",
      "UTSA is proud to have such a sense of community among its students, staff, and faculty, and Lance is proof that each Roadrunner has their own unique experiences within that community.\n",

      "There were many factors that drew Gabby to UTSA. One thing that stood out was the Roadrunner family. “I truly feel that UTSA has a very welcoming community.” Other things that drew Gabby to UTSA were its location as well as the financial aid opportunities she received.\n",
      "As a Bold Promise student, her full tuition and mandatory fees are covered by UTSA. As a Terry Scholar within the Honors College, Gabby has also received full coverage of eight semesters worth of tuition and fees, books, housing, and a meal plan, as well as the chance to qualify for funding for a study abroad experience. It’s because of these opportunities that she’s able to go to college at all. “It just wasn’t something that my family prepared for. Being a part of the Bold Promise program has given me the opportunity to pursue my higher education.” Thanks to UTSA’s financial aid opportunities, Gabby is now a proud first-generation Roadrunner.\n",
      "The diverse, inclusive community at UTSA has given Gabby a deep appreciation of not only her financial aid but also her major. As an Education Interdisciplinary Studies major focusing on Early Education, she feels that it’s important to understand backgrounds different from your own, because, as she says, “No two students are going to be the same, and no two educators are going to be the same.” This has been especially true at UTSA, as Gabby has learned. “The diversity here is truly amazing and it’s hands-down my favorite thing about UTSA.”\n",
      "Gabby encourages students applying to UTSA to reach out when they have questions. “I know that’s something I was scared to do, but there are always people that are willing to help.”\n",

He also states that the diverse body of students and staff are another part of what made the school stand out to him.\n",
      "After graduation, Jeremiah would like to start his own business. He plans to open venue halls across San Antonio. He’s drawn to this business because he loves the idea of meeting new people and networking. UTSA helped him get an early start. He’s part of the fraternity Kappa Sigma, which he saw as a good way to make the friends and business connections he wanted. It paid off from the beginning. Since joining, he’s met many fraternity brothers and alumni, making more connections and finding more opportunities through UTSA than he’d hoped for.\n",

The center also helped Azizah by promoting events and activities that encouraged students to form good study habits and other helpful practices.\n",

You're just like any other student. Live in the dorm. Join a fraternity or sorority. Play intramural sports. The difference is in the elective courses you take. In addition to your regular college courses, you enroll in one AFROTC course per semester through the Department of Aerospace Studies. If you do not attend UTSA, you will still take the AFROTC courses at UTSA as a crosstown student. These courses, along with a two-week summer course, provide the framework for your officer training.\n",

      "Joining the program is as simple as registering for our Aerospace Studies class. As a new cadet, you can expect to spend about five hours in ROTC activities per week. You can register for either a Tuesday or Thursday 1-credit hour class (see below). When you register for class, you'll also be automatically registered for a 2-hour lab on Thursday 4:00-5:45. Make sure you don't have any class schedule conflicts. Finally, you'll join the cadet corps for physical training on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. If you have any questions about registering, call us at (210) 458-4624.\n",
      "If you have less than 36 credit hours when you join, you’ll need to register for:\n",
      "(Fall) ASC 1031 Foundation of the US Air Force I\n",
      "(Spring) ASC 1041 Foundation of the US Air Force II\n",
      "If you have more than 36 undergraduate credit hours, contact the Unit Admissions Officer to find out which ASC class you should sign up for.\n",

      "You must be medically qualified to enter the military. As an eligibility requirement, we’ll make arrangements to send you for a physical exam during the second semester. There are two separate appointments and these could take several hours. It’s often easier for students to get this done before classes begin. If you want, come in and ask us how to arrange this physical exam during the summer or winter break. Bring a copy of your class registration so we see that you’ve signed up for the correct Aerospace Studies class. We’ll also give you information on how to prepare for the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test.\n",

      "The NSF federally-funded UTSA APPEX (Academic Personal and Professional Excellence) Research Training Program and Scholarship guides students towards academic and research excellence, while promoting their long-term well-being and resilience. Its goal is to develop future scientists at all levels of education, who contribute to the national STEM workforce. APPEX lays strong foundations through academic enrichment, financial support, faculty and peer mentoring, training in psychosocial skills and cognition, and engagement in UTSA research laboratories.\n",
      "In partnership with program directors and mentors in their fields, all scholars develop an individual development plan that will assist them to attain their STEM career goals and prepare them for graduate education, as desired. APPEX Scholars are recruited from incoming Freshman STEM students in majors listed below. Admission to APPEX grants automatic admission to both the UTSA Honors College and College of Sciences Honors programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is Eligible?\n",
      "\n",
      "APPEX Scholars should be high-achieving students who are interested in completing STEM degrees and STEM-related occupations. Particular attention is given to those with research experience or a desire to pursue a PhD. The APPEX program is not designed to support pre-health students, unless they desire to be medical scientists (MD/PhD). Included majors are Biology, Chemistry or Biochemistry, Microbiology & Immunology, Neuroscience, Physics, and Math.\n",
      "\n",
      "Program Details\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout their studies, APPEX Scholars take part in well-being training, pre-research training, and then in meaningful research laboratory engagement. They also engage in peer and faculty mentoring and academic assistance programs, and develop strong foundations for success.\n",
      "- Just prior to their first semester, all Scholars will attend a one-day introductory Boot Camp.\n",
      "- In their first semester, Scholars will initially engage in a common AIS Course designed to provide foundations in academic, well-being, research career development, and presentation skills. They will also attend occasional APPEX meetings.\n",
      "- Following their first semester, Scholars participate in stage-specific group meetings designed to continue group connection and stage-specific training in professional/career development and personal well-being.\n",
      "- By their second year, Scholars are encouraged to begin working in research labs at UTSA.\n",
      "- As rising third-years or earlier, Scholars are highly encouraged enter a summer research training program at one of the top research institutes in the country.\n",
      "- APPEX Scholars may also opt to become MARC-2 trainees and affiliate with the NIH MARC Training Program and complete training designed to prepare them for submission of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and doctoral program matriculation. Trainees in MARC and its affiliates have very strong placement records into some of the top biomedical research programs in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "- During all Fall and Spring semesters, Scholars receive monthly support amounting up to $4000 per semester ($8000/year) for up to four years. APPEX funding is need-based so it must fit into the students’ cost of attendance. Scholars who do not have unmet need can participate in the program on a voluntary basis, as APPEX-2 trainees.\n",
      "- In their third year, Scholars receive $500 towards attendance to a national student research conference and receive guidance on how to write travel scholarships and awards.\n",

If you have any doubts that a person will evaluate you well, ask them whether they \"know you well enough to write a strong recommendation for you.\" People don't like writing bad recommendations and this way you give them an easy way to turn you down rather than writing a bad or very scanty recommendation. Realize, however, that even a scanty recommendation is better than not turning one in at all or not applying.\n",

Set up an appointment and provide them with a letter detailing your future goals and the program to which you are applying, as well as a copy of your résumé/CV.\n",
      "- PhDs often need to be reminded and are not annoyed if you do it politely. Follow up with your recommenders to make sure that the letters are actually sent. The \"squeaky wheel gets the grease\" really works in this circumstance.\n",

In our search for new reactions we strive to develop catalytic and generally applicable processes with potential to streamline present day synthetic approaches and solve their long-standing problems. In total synthesis we accentuate brevity, efficiency and flexibility in generation of molecular complexity.\n",
      "Dr. McHardy's lab is focused on medicinal chemistry research in the design, synthesis and development of small molecule compounds across multiple therapeutic disease areas.\n",
      "Research in the Schanze Lab is focused on the interaction of light with small molecules, polymers, and materials. We have an interest in photochemical and photophysical processes that are stimulated when molecular systems absorb light. Most of our current work centers on studies that explore the phenomenon of luminescence (light emission).\n",
      "Research activities in my laboratory are concerned with the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of new transition-metal containing molecules relevant to catalysis and biomimetic chemistry. We are particularly interested in the chemistry of alkyl complexes of Mn, Fe, and Co, as these compounds occupy a unique place at the interface of traditional organometallic molecules that obey the 18-electron rule, and classical coordination complexes that tend to display various spin states.\n",
      "I will teach students how to express and purify human enzymes from bacteria. By using the tools (enzymes and chemical probes) they create independently, the students will learn how to run enzymology assays using LC-MS or LC-UV detection approaches, and in turn, will make new discoveries that will impact human health.\n",
      "Research focus includes: 1) Asymmetric synthesis and reactions: Design and synthesis of new chiral ligands for asymmetric epoxidations, C-H oxidations and episulfidations, and application of these new methodologies in asymmetric synthesis; 2) Small ring compounds: Synthesis and reactions of dioxiranes, cyclopropanes, episulfides, oxaziridinium salts and organometallic peroxo complexes; 3) Oxidation: Novel asymmetric oxidations with dioxiranes, oxaziridinium salts and MTO; and 4) Phosphorus chemistry: Application of cyclopropyl phosphine oxides in the synthesis of heterocyclic nature products.\n",
      "I am an Applied Mathematician working in mathematical biology and have particular interests in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, computational epidemiology, dynamical systems, and numerical methods for partial differential equations.\n",
      "Dr. Stamova's research interests lie in the area of mathematical modeling and analysis using nonlinear systems, stability, and control theories with an emphasis on problems related to neural networks, biological models, models in the population dynamics, and models in economics.\n",
      "Areas of research include high-efficiency photovoltaics, down-shifting quantum dots, metallic nanoparticles and their plasmonic effects, drug eluting bio-absorbable stents, sensor arrays, power generation from wearable fabrics, hyperlenses, metamaterials, chemical sensors and micro-chemical reactors on robotic platforms, microactuators for radar applications, printable electronics, nanotechnology, CMOS-compatible microwave varactors, among others. Intellectual property generation and the fabrication and characterization of laboratory prototypes are strongly emphasized.\n",
      "Two main research areas include: (i) protein conformational changes induced by exogenous molecules: research investigates the binding of porphyrin-like photosensitizers to globular proteins (currently lactoglobulin and tubulin) and the effect of the irradiation of the porphyrin/protein complex on the conformation (secondary and tertiary) of the protein; and (ii) use of smart materials for the formation of coexisting phospholipid phases: investigating the deposition of phospholipid bilayers on highly epitaxial ferroelectric film.\n",
      "Research focus includes: 1) Atomic force microscopy: current pursuit includes extensions and applications of this new formula into various biomolecules; 2) Molecular motors: current efforts are to build a three-dimensional multi-body model and to establish atomistic simulations for refining the model parameters; 3) Non-equilibrium statistical physics - Langevin dynamics (stochastic processes) is ubiquitous in materials physics, chemistry, and engineering. Yet its solution is very difficult to achieve for most problems of fundamental and practical importance. Base on its path integral formulation, systematic approximations and numerical methods are being developed for physical and biochemical systems; 4) Transition and reaction pathways: research efforts in this area are to compute fluctuations around the minimum energy path and to develop efficient algorithms for transition path sampling; and 5) Electronic transport in semiconductor nanostructures.\n",
      "Our research focuses on the development and application of new statistical mechanical theories and computational approaches combined with simulation techniques to describe physical phenomena in a broad range of applications relevant to chemistry, physics, biology and engineering. The areas of interest include the study of the molecular mechanisms governing ligand-receptor affinities and molecular recognition for elucidating the structure, function, and physiological roles of: 1) biomolecules immersed in aqueous environments; 2) ion diffusion and selectivity through realistic models of biological ion channel proteins; 3) nanoparticles interacting with surfaces (membranes); and 4) drug delivery therapies and aggregation of highly charged macroions.\n",
      "Our lab uses optical techniques to study the bio-nano interface. In particular, we specialize in the detection and imaging of single molecules, and the interaction of molecules with metal surfaces. We are currently developing three major projects: 1) the use of ultra-sensitive localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensors to measure molecular binding and conformational changes on surfaces; 2) super-resolution microscopy studies of surface bound molecules, including nanoparticle-bound antibodies; and 3) single-molecule kinetics studies based upon microwell technology.\n",
      "My work is related to the interdisciplinary connections between the mathematical models derived from Kinetic Theory, the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of Quantum and (Semi-)Classical Physics phenomena, and their different computational modeling techniques. Current work encompasses, for example, Entropy-stable Discontinuous Galerkin schemes for Boltzmann-Poisson models of collisional electronic transport along energy bands, inverse problems in Electrochemistry solved via Bayesian Estimation and Multi-Objective Optimization techniques, Uncertainty Quantification in the Boltzmann-Poisson system for semiconductors, among others. Thus, this work has potential implications for pure research in Quantum Mechanics phenomena such as electron transport, for example, as well as for applied research in the context of nanotechnology and Li-ion batteries, with the aid of Computational Science.\n",
      "Our group investigates various nanomaterials through their unique optical signatures. The goal is to understand the structure-function relationship of these materials through their unique optical signatures and responses in a variety of matrices. Our fabrication techniques include wet chemical synthesis and characterization techniques focus on optical spectroscopy. Additionally, we work with collaborators to establish unique applications for these materials, particularly in the area of biophotonics.\n",
      "My research is focused on the study of the crystalline structure of materials and their physical properties through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron diffraction.\n",
      "Dr. Baumann's primary research streams involve studying how people work together in groups and when they do, or do not, work well (intra-group processes and group decision making), factors affecting the impressions people form of each other (impression formation), and how each of these is influenced by things like emotional state (effects of affect on decision making and behavior).\n",
      "Our lab studies aspects of hearing that are particularly important to humans, such as determining where a sound is coming from or recognizing speech and music. We examine how auditory processing is affected by attention, memory, and the relations between perception and action.\n",
      "Dr. Houpt specializes in mathematical cognitive modeling as a framework for both understanding the underlying processes and for measuring human perception and performance. He is particularly interested in research at the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence.\n",
      "My research interests involve examining general processes involved in social perception, such as physical attractiveness, physical appearance, race, and gender. I also investigate these social perceptual factors in prejudice and stereotyping processes, social interactions, and attitudes. Other research areas include personality influences in social behavior and the dynamics of online social interactions. I also investigate the application of social psychological principles in the area of health-related attitudes and behaviors. Most recently, I am examining variables that affect or influence college students' performance in an academic setting (e.g., doing well in a traditionally difficult class).\n",
      "Dr. Meca's research program focuses on identity development across various domains and on the links between identity and psychosocial functioning. Although he studies identity development broadly, the majority of his research has focused on cultural identity, particularly among Hispanic/Latinx youth.\n",

      "MARC, MARC-2, and WSRTP students are expected to take the next steps in their educational path either immediately or within a year or so of graduation. Generally, those who fully participate in the programs for two or more years have sufficient training/background that they can enter doctoral programs directly.\n",
      "Below is a list of Partner and \"Friend\" PhD programs with which the UTSA program has worked closely in the past, as well as several combined government/institutional and private/institutional PhD programs and individual university PhD programs. Additionally, there is the option of internships. Guides to various ratings of these programs are also provided, although nothing is better than your research mentor's input and visits to the campuses.\n",
      "Those who are unable to immediately pursue doctoral education have several pathways. The most well known is to pursue a master's, but you will usually need to take out loans or work many hours being a teaching assistant. Below are listed several \"Bridge\" Masters-to-PhD programs that provide funding, student training, pre-PhD training, and academic support.\n",
      "Students who merely need some additional years of research experience should consider training in a postbacc program which also provides financial and training support, but this is generally limited to one year and does not result in a master's degree. Included is a list of postbacc and bridge MS programs that former program students have attended and commented about.\n",

They take courses and participate in activities to enhance their professional and leadership development. They are introduced to a broad range of scientific disciplines and are provided with networking opportunities with representatives of some of the nation's top research universities. It is the goal of our program that all of our students continue their education to higher levels, obtain their doctoral degree, and pursue satisfying research careers.\n",
      "The RISE program has been active at UTSA since 2000, but is now in its last year of funding. To expend residual funds, we are also recruiting a cohort of final-year undergraduates on track to earn their bachelorâs degrees in Spring 2024, who desire a PhD but need additional preparation. We expect that most of these students will have minimal training in research. We will provide intensive research and professional training between Summer 2023 (full time participation required) and Spring 2024. Our goal is to help these students to develop at least into excellent candidates for postbaccalaureate and funded masterâs program by the time they graduate and soon after gain admission to top doctoral programs. Funding will last through March 2024 but we are exploring means to funding trainees through graduation.\n",

      "The choice is ultimately yours. What may be best for other people you know may not be best for you. So in this article, we’ll break down some key differences between an online university and a community college to help arm you with the information you need to make the best decision for your unique situation.\n",
      "What to Consider\n",
      "There are several factors to consider when deciding between a community college and an online university. At a community college, you can earn an associate’s degree that can help you narrow down your field of interest. This type of degree often takes approximately two years to complete and can potentially put you on a path towards a four-year degree.\n",
      "While both options may provide you with the flexibility you need to achieve your academic goals around your schedule, let’s look at other factors that may impact your decision about whether to attend community college or an online university.\n",
      "Transferability of Courses\n",
      "When attending a community college, it’s essential to consider what courses you’re taking and whether or not they’ll transfer to a four-year institution in the future. This is especially important for specialized programs or out-of-state universities that might recognize different courses.\n",
      "Sometimes, an online university and a community college will have matriculation agreements. For example,\n",
      "UTSA has agreements with Alamo Colleges and Austin Community Colleges\n",
      "that allow students to better plan their transfer credits between the institutions.\n",
      "With UTSA Online, however, your catalog year is locked in from the start. You won’t have to worry about unforeseen course requirements popping up, because you’ll know exactly what you need to take to build your Bold Future.\n",
      "Subject Matter\n",
      "In the case of specialized degree programs, it may be best to complete your full degree at the same university. This will ensure you learn all the right skills in your lower division classes so you won’t need to take additional courses to prepare you to advance in your program, which would cost more money and could cause a delay in your graduation.\n",
      "For example, UTSA and the Alamo Colleges both teach programming classes, but those classes may focus on different languages. By starting in\n",
      "UTSA’s 100% online Cyber Security degree\n",
      ", you’ll be sure to learn the right skills you need to advance in the program on the timeline you and your advisor set.\n",
      "Relationship Building\n",
      "By attending an online university and earning a degree from one school, you’ll have the opportunity to foster longer-term relationships with your professors.\n",
      "For example, you may find a course from a communication teacher when you first start. By completing all four years in one program, you may be able to take multiple courses from that same instructor. Beyond taking classes from someone you like, this could be beneficial for networking opportunities in the future.\n",
      "Guarantee of Online Classes\n",
      "While many community colleges have begun offering more online classes, they may not offer your full degree plan entirely online. Instead, they might offer these flexible options on a course-by-course basis, and some of the fully online courses may require you to meet at specific times.\n",
      "At UTSA Online, we guarantee that all courses will be 100% online with no specific meeting times. This means you’ll have deadlines for your coursework each week, but you get to decide when to complete your classes around your already busy schedule. There’s also no need to drive to campus and pay for parking, because you can study wherever you are.\n",
      "FAFSA Changes\n",
      "While community colleges have traditionally been the most cost-effective route, did you know there have been changes to the FAFSA that may mean you qualify for higher amounts of financial aid?\n",
      "Make sure you don’t assume community college will be the cheaper route. Explore all your options, making sure to factor in external financial aid opportunities as well. If you do qualify for enough to make an online university the better option, you can save time and money by starting at your chosen institution instead of attempting to transfer later.\n",
      "Advisors that know the Curriculum\n",
      "Community college advisors are often expected to know the transfer plans for multiple universities. This can be quite the task to keep up with, especially when those transfer plans or approved classes can change term over term or year over year! Everyone tries their best to keep up with and communicate any updates and/or changes to articulation agreements, but everyone is also human. .\n",
      "Student Support\n",
      "At UTSA Online, you’ll have access to\n",
      "free mental health resources through TimelyCare\n",
      ",\n",

      "in your academic journey and beyond.\n",
      "You’ll also learn from world-renowned faculty who are experts in their field. These leaders and pioneers typically have PhDs, while at community colleges some professors may not have a terminal degree.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The choice between an online university and a community college is a significant decision that should be made after careful reflection and research. It’s about more than just the obvious aspects like the number of years it’ll take to earn your degree.\n",
      "As you navigate through your options, remember that the most critical factor is choosing the path that works best for your educational and career goals. It’s your journey, your career, and your life, so feel empowered to make the decision that’s best for you.\n",

      "Online classes could be a great option for you if:\n",
      "You’re looking for flexibility to accommodate your busy schedule.\n",
      "You don’t have the resources to attend in-person classes, such as transportation.\n",
      "You like to take your time with the material, without being bound to a specific amount of time in a class.\n",
      "With online courses, you won’t have to commute to campus and sit through class. Online programs offer you the ability to learn and grow without affecting your personal, professional, and academic life balance.\n",
      "Personalized Learning Environment\n",
      "One of the significant advantages of online learning is the ability to create a personalized learning environment. You can study in your favorite coffee shop,\n",
      "at home\n",
      ", or while you’re traveling. With this flexibility, you can choose a study setting that is most conducive to your learning style. This will help you absorb information better and retain it longer.\n",
      "Access to a Variety of Resources\n",
      "Online classes often provide a wealth of resources and can make classes easily accessible. For example, if lectures are recorded, you can watch the material again, or pause it while you take notes. This can alleviate potential stress from trying to keep up with a live presentation.\n",
      "At UTSA Online, you’ll have a wealth of\n",

      "mental health support\n",
      ", we’re here for you. The variety of options can enhance your learning experience and provide multiple avenues for understanding complex concepts.\n",
      "In-Person Classes are Active and Involved\n",
      "Hands-on learning is an important part of all classes offered at UTSA. Group discussions and projects help some students better understand course material while also getting to know their classmates and professors and building connections with them.\n",
      "This interaction and relationship-building aspect can be accomplished both in person and online at UTSA. However, if you learn best by being in a classroom, having face-to-face interactions, and being involved in clubs and organizations, then you might benefit more from in-person classes.\n",
      "Immediate Feedback and Clarification\n",
      "One advantage of in-person classes is the ability to receive immediate feedback and clarification from instructors. If you have a question during a lecture, you can ask it on the spot and get an immediate response. This can be particularly beneficial for complex subjects where a quick explanation can make a significant difference in understanding. With online classes, you’ll still be able to receive feedback through email and during virtual office hours. However, it won’t be as immediate as in a classroom.\n",
      "Networking Opportunities\n",
      "In-person classes offer valuable networking opportunities. Some people prefer building relationships with peers, professors, and industry professionals through face-to-face interactions. These connections can lead to internships, job opportunities, and collaborations.\n",
      "However, online programs also provide robust opportunities for networking and relationship-building. Virtual platforms allow you to interact with classmates and instructors through different avenues. Platforms like discussion forums and video conferences foster meaningful connections that can lead to similar career-enhancing opportunities.\n",
      "Online Classes Offer Flexibility\n",
      "Online classes would be perfect for you if:\n",
      "Work full-time\n",
      "Have a family and kids\n",
      "Take care of an ill loved one\n",
      "Are experiencing any life changes that would make attending class on campus an extra complication in your life\n",
      "Or a combination of these.\n",
      "100% online classes will allow you to advance your education at your own pace. You’ll get to organize your schedule however works best for you.\n",
      "In-Person Classes Make it Harder for Distractions\n",
      "For some students, taking online classes might be a little too flexible. This type of student needs a more strict schedule to follow. For that reason, online classes might leave room for too many distractions that keep them from staying focused on their class.\n",
      "In-person classes may be a better option for those students since classrooms create an environment that allows them to focus on the coursework. Having a set class schedule to follow might help them organize their own schedule better as well. Additionally, the opportunity to participate in real-time discussions and activities can enhance comprehension and engagement. In-person classes may work for you if education is your number one priority and if you are able to organize the rest of your responsibilities around your class times.\n",
      "Online Programs are Often More Affordable\n",
      "Online programs are usually less expensive than on-campus classes since online students don’t need to be provided with the same type of resources as traditional students. With online classes, you don’t need to worry about paying student amenity fees or getting expensive on-campus parking passes. Although you won’t be paying for those extra amenities, you’ll still have excellent student support through the resources UTSA Online provides for its students.\n",
      "UTSA Online’s tuition is $486-$525 per credit hour for undergraduate courses and $550-$825 per credit hour for graduate courses, depending on your area of study. This cost is all-inclusive, meaning that there are no additional fees. Another benefit of enrolling in a UTSA Online program is that there is no out-of-state tuition. You’ll pay the same price regardless of where you live. If you’re looking to save yourself commuting time and money, then online classes may be the best choice for you.\n",
      "Choosing between Online and In-Person Learning\n",
      "Another important fact to consider is the time you have available for school. If you have a busy lifestyle, then an online program will allow you to obtain your degree at a pace that works with the other aspects of your life.\n",
      "At UTSA Online, we understand that your journey is unique.

      "The Bottom Line\n",
      "The debate between online and in-person learning is not about determining which is superior, but rather understanding which format suits your personal circumstances and learning style better. Both online and in-person classes have their distinct advantages and challenges.\n",
      "Online learning offers unparalleled flexibility, a personalized learning environment, and cost-effectiveness, making it an excellent choice for those with busy schedules or budget constraints.\n",
      "On the other hand, in-person learning provides immediate feedback, valuable networking opportunities, and a structured environment, which can be beneficial for students who thrive on routine and face-to-face interactions.\n",

      "Online vs. Traditional Learning\n",
      "When deciding between\n",
      "online and traditional learning\n",
      ", it’s important to consider your personal circumstances and learning preferences. Each mode of education has its own set of advantages and challenges. Understanding these can help you make an informed decision.\n",
      "Personalized Learning Experience\n",
      "Online education can provide you with a more personalized learning experience. You can tailor your study schedule to fit your personal and professional commitments.\n",
      "This flexibility is especially useful if you have an unpredictable schedule or need to balance multiple responsibilities. Additionally, with UTSA Online, you’ll be able to use a\n",
      "whole host of resources\n",
      ". You’ll have access to everything from our learning management system (Canvas) to our online library services.\n",
      "Additionally, you’ll be able to earn\n",
      "microcredentials\n",
      "(like certificates and badges) from companies like Google, IBM, Adobe Creative Cloud, and more!\n",
      "Interaction and Networking\n",
      "If you’re worried about the lack of face-to-face interaction in online learning, don’t stress. With UTSA Online, you’ll have plenty of virtual networking opportunities. From online discussion boards to group projects and virtual office hours, you’ll still get to experience community and collaboration. These interactions can be just as meaningful and productive as those in a traditional classroom setting.\n",
      "Cost-Effectiveness\n",
      "Another significant\n",
      "advantage of online learning is cost-effectiveness\n",
      ". Traditional on-campus programs often come with additional expenses like commuting, housing, and campus fees.\n",
      "With UTSA Online, you’ll pay one flat rate. There are no additional fees or out of state tuition costs. This makes higher education more accessible to a broader range of students.\n",
      "Flexibility and Convenience\n",
      "One of the biggest benefits of online education is the flexibility it offers. At UTSA, you can access the same quality education as our in-person students. But your classes will be 100% online. This way, you get to take classes whenever and wherever it’s convenient for you.\n",
      "Online classes are a great option if you don’t live near the university you want to attend or if local schools don’t offer the program you’re interested in. Plus, online education offers more accessibility – you won’t have to commute, find parking, or stick to a rigid class schedule. Everything is designed to fit around your life.\n",
      "6 Benefits to Earning an Online Degree from UTSA\n",
      "An online degree offers you enhanced\n",
      "career opportunities\n",

      "3. More Free Time\n",
      "Being in charge of your own schedule gives you the freedom to complete your courses and assignments at your convenience. If you’re a morning person and want to complete your work at 6 a.m., great! But if you prefer to relax after a long day and then tackle your work at 9 p.m., you’ll have the flexibility to do that. This balance is crucial for maintaining mental and physical well-being.\n",
      "4. Independence\n",
      "As we mentioned above, online classes can be taken anywhere. This means you can study from the comfort of your home, during your lunch break, or even while traveling. You don’t need to put your education on hold.\n",
      "You’ll have the autonomy to direct your own learning. There’s no worrying about fitting into a specific class time or being restricted by a professor’s office hours. You can pace your learning according to your own needs and preferences, which can lead to a deeper understanding of the material. You’ll have due dates each week, but you’ll complete your coursework on your own schedule.\n",
      "5. Career Advancement\n",
      "Earning your degree online offers you the opportunity to expand your professional horizons without compromising other aspects of your life. UTSA Online is designed with working professionals in mind. We offer courses that are directly applicable to your current job or desired career path.\n",

      "An online degree is just as powerful as an in-person degree, so you can approach the professional world with confidence and the readiness to succeed in your dream career path as you achieve your Bold Future. While you start, or continue, building your life as a professional, you can create a strong foundation by taking a few key steps before and after you graduate from your online program.\n",

      "Build A Professional Mindset\n",
      "One of the most important transitions after receiving your degree is recognizing that you are no longer a student and are now a budding professional ready to start an exciting career. The first key to success is developing your mindset as an authority in your field.\n",
      "Use the confidence of completing your degree program to see yourself as a professional with a world of potential. Some tips to keep in mind for building a professional mindset include:\n",
      "Embrace the importance of lifelong learning by continuing to teach yourself after you graduate\n",
      "Find role models in your industry and study some of their accolades\n",
      "Be open to growth and learn how to celebrate your successes while recognizing areas of improvement\n",
      "In addition to these strategies, embrace ways to grow in your professional role by pursuing helpful credentials or certificates. Identify what your company values, whether that’s knowledge of tools like Microsoft Suite or skills like project management, so that you can continue to develop capabilities that will carry you and your organization forward.\n",
      "Network\n",
      "Networking is a crucial skill after you receive your degree. A network of friendly and knowledgeable people in your field is one of the most valuable resources in the professional world.\n",
      "Here are some great networking tips:\n",
      "Be friendly and speak to your colleagues as human beings, not just stepping stones in your career—this will help you build themost successful and lasting relationships.\n",
      "Prepare your elevator pitch, a brief, usually 30-second, introduction to who you are that gives an overview of your professional accomplishments and goals.\n",
      "Find events with like-minded people. These events don’t necessarily have to be oriented toward finding a job and can be more casual, like mixers and meet and greets.\n",
      "Start the networking process before you finish your program. Talk to your professors and classmates and discuss your goals.\n",
      "Ask questions and approach the process ready to learn.\n",
      "Remember that networking doesn’t always have to have the endgame of finding a job. Meeting new people and learning from them is a great way to help you simply learn more about your desired field.\n",
      "Learn about associations that may include professionals like you across your regional area, state, or even nationally. Join them so that you can learn from other like-minded professionals in your area!\n",
      "There are so many benefits to gain from meeting new people and hearing about their experiences. As you look to build your network, remember to be yourself and embrace the process with an open mind, and you will go far.\n",
      "Start the Job Search\n",
      "Once you’ve taken the steps to craft your professional mindset and prepare, you can jump into the job search. Searching for your first job post-graduation can take some perseverance, but with the right preparation, you are sure to find success.\n",
      "Use Your Resources\n",
      "Knowing which tools to use in your job search can help set you up for success. Two of the most valuable resources you can use in the job search include:\n",

      "– Like Indeed, LinkedIn can help you find personalized job listings. However, LinkedIn is also a great tool to help you with networking and reaching out to people in your field as you look for potential roles.\n",

      "When creating your resume, keep some of these tips in mind:\n",
      "A resume should be easy-to-read and direct, covering only relevant information without including excess details\n",
      "Personalize your resume as much as possible—even if you use a template, put your own spin on it\n",
      "Review your resume for proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, and headings\n",
      "Employers only look at a resume very briefly, so use actionable keywords and include skills that are relevant to the job you are applying for to catch their eye\n",

      "Leo Bannister is the Assistant Director of Medical Humanities and an Assistant Professor of Practice at UTSA in the Interdisciplinary School for Engagement. He is a husband, father, retired OEF and OIF combat veteran, who was born and raised in San Antonio Texas. While he did not know it at the time he was brought up in a home that set the foundation for what would later become one of his greatest passions, philosophy and ethics. This groundwork festered with not much direction for years during his service in the Army questioning everything, all the while seeking greater purpose and meaning. It wasn’t until he met his wife, his guiding light, that the quest seemed to take shape. She helped him though his combat injuries after his return from Iraq and gave him the confidence and support to move forward after retirement to be a first-generation student who received his graduate degree in Applied Philosophy and Ethics from Texas State University.\n",
      "Since 2014 he has served as a judge for the Annual Texas Regional Ethics Bowl at St. Mary’s University. He has been teaching various humanities and philosophy courses in the San Antonio area since 2015. Leo has been a part of and taught several classes in the Medical Humanities program at UTSA since the Fall of 2016.\n",

Each class will be guided by award-winning UTSA professors and exceptional student mentors, and discussions will center around how the pivotal texts that we read help us to understand the intersecting relationships of migration, democracy, and freedom.\n",

Students will receive tutelage on college-level academic skills, the college admissions and financial aid processes, university life, choosing a major, applying for funding opportunities like scholarships, and many other topics that can confuse students during the college application process.\n",

Upon admission to candidacy and the formation of the student’s dissertation committee, the program of study comes under the purview of the Dissertation Committee, which reviews the proposed program of study and recommends to the Graduate Program Committee any additional course requirements. The final program of study, as approved by the Graduate Program Committee, is then recommended to the academic College and the Graduate School for approval. Approval of the final program of study by the Graduate School is a degree requirement. All completed coursework included in the final program of study must have been taken within the preceding eight years. No course for which a grade of less than “C” was earned can be applied to the doctoral degree.\n",

The chair of the Dissertation Committee ordinarily serves as the supervisor of research. Other members of the committee should be consulted as appropriate. Occasionally, a research professor or researcher who is not a member of the Graduate Faculty may be recommended by the Graduate Program Committee to serve as the supervisor for a specific dissertation because his or her expertise would be valuable to the student. When the research supervisor is not a member of the Graduate Faculty in the student’s area of study, a member of the Graduate Program Committee will be appointed as co-chair of the Dissertation Committee.

      "Students engage in the design process from start to finish with an emphasis on sustainability as they deliver products to clients. EPICS are multi-year ventures with students encouraged to work on a project for at least one year. The course structure proposed has a 2-credit hour introduction and a 1-credit continuation each year tied to the service-based project and offered at freshman, sophomore, junior and senior levels. There is also the option of working on Senior Design projects for 2 or 3 SCH a semester upon departmental approval.\n",
      "Why enroll in EPICS\n",
      "By enrolling in EPICS program students get the chance to get a glimpse of their life as professionals. They work as a team while the community partner is their “client”. Students get to work on all stages of a project, starting from identification and conceptual design to developing the prototype and maintenance. They learn how to be a team member or how to lead a team. They receive hands on experience working with fellow students from various disciplines as well as with community partners on a real project. They become a part of a meaningful network within society and receive credit while doing so. At the end of their studies, they get rewarded with EPICS Program certificate.\n",
      "EPICS students are encouraged to be independent and take responsibility of their project; yet they get guidance from faculty who have experience on the subject matter. Students initiate, design, and develop the project with constant help and guidance from their mentor. Therefore, we have different mentors for different projects based on the requirements. Students meet with their mentor regularly, and receive community partner’s input as well.\n",
      "Production phase of the project is realized either at a lab or at the Makerspace. The Makerspace has state of the art tools and equipment that foster the students’ desire learn and do. Before starting producing the project or the prototype, students receive the training they need to be able to use the facilities and utilize tools and equipment.\n",
      "Evaluation and assessment of students in EPICS classes consist of the project deliverables, project mentor’s evaluations, and team members’ evaluations of each other. Students learn to be responsible to their community partners and team members at a very early stage during the project. Besides the regular meetings of the team members and their mentor, each team gives two presentations each semester to update their client, aka community partner.\n",

      "\n",
      "Turbulent boundary layers that evolve along the flow direction are ubiquitous. Computationally speaking, this type of boundary layer poses an enormous challenge, due to the need for accurate and time-dependent inflow turbulence information. Moreover, accounting for the effects of wall-curvature driven pressure gradient and flow compressibility adds significant complexity to the problem. Consequently, hypersonic spatially-developing turbulent boundary layers (SDTBL) over curved walls are of crucial importance in aerospace applications, such as unmanned high-speed vehicles, scramjets and advanced space aircrafts. More importantly, hypersonic capabilities would provide faster responsiveness and longer range coverage to U.S. Air Force systems. Furthermore, an air transportation vehicle travelling at a Mach number of 5.1 might cover the New York-London route in roughly 75 minutes. Thus, the acquired understanding of the physics behind hypersonic boundary layers over curved wall-bounded flows can lead to the development of more efficient control techniques for the fluid flow (e.g., wave drag reduction) and aerodynamic heating on hypersonic vehicle design. In this sense, state-of-the-art numerical simulations performed at the petascale level will be able to supply rich and valuable information.\n",
      "We seek to develop a robust turbulent inflow generation methodology for hypersonic SDTBL (Mach numbers up to 5) in a suite of high spatial/temporal resolution Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) as well as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) at higher Reynolds numbers. The prescription of realistic inflow turbulent conditions is used to evaluate the downstream influence of convex (favorable pressure gradient) and concave (adverse pressure gradient) wall curvatures on: (i) low/high order statistics of ow parameters (velocity, density, pressure and temperature), (ii) intermittency, (iii) energy budget, (iv) power spectra of velocity/temperature fluctuations, and (v) the strong Reynolds analogy (SRA) relations. Furthermore, the extensive information supplied by DNS allows us: (i) to assess the impact of wall-curvature driven pressure gradients on the large-scale structures, and (ii) to propose improvements to sub-grid scale (SGS) turbulence models for the LES approach. The proposed open-source finite-element flow solver (PHASTA) has been able to simulate complex geometries and has shown a great scalability for petascale computing in more than 512,000 cores in Mira (Argonne’s 10 Petaflop Supercomputer). To our knowledge, the proposed petascale DNS/LES study on hypersonic boundary layers on complex geometries and high Reynolds numbers is carried out for the first time.\n",
      "The proposed petascale DNS contributes to better understanding of supersonic/ hypersonic SDTBL under the influence of concave/convex curvature, which can lead to the determination of appropriate flow control tools and design optimization in hypersonics science. We will do the highest possible and practical Reynolds number for DNS to compare to Wall Resolved LES. Then we will push the Wall Resolved LES up to higher Reynolds numbers, similar to experimental ones from the literature. Since most of the studies on the role of wall curvature-driven pressure gradients in hypersonic boundary layers have focused only on the velocity field, the proposed numerical experiments will be used to enhance the understanding of the thermal field, as well. Therefore, the uniqueness of this work lies in strengthening the fundamental knowledge of the thermal transport on supersonic/hypersonic curved wall-bounded flows.\n",

Time-dependent 3D flow visualization involves dealing with massive amounts of data, which implies huge computational resources, not to mention a previous Navier-Stokes equation solving. The main research objectives are three-fold: (i) to perform DNS of spatially-developing turbulent boundary layers subject to streamwise pressure gradients with passive scalar transport, (ii) to conduct post-processing interface software development in order to make DNS data readable by Autodesk Maya, Blender, Paraview and Unity-3D game engine, and (iii) to carry out scientific visualization of turbulent structures and events by means of flow animations and fully immersive approach or virtual reality (VR).

      "Incompressible jets transversely issuing into a spatially-developing turbulent boundary layer is one of the most challenging types of three dimensional flows due to its thermal-fluid complexity and technological applications; for instance, film cooling of turbine blades, fuel or dilution air injection in gas turbine engines, thrust vector control, chimney plumes, just to name a few. The ability to control a flow field in such a way to enhance thermal efficiency is of crucial relevance in aerospace and other engineering applications. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) with high spatial and temporal resolution of jets in crossflow subject to very strong Favorable Pressure Gradient (FPG) has been successfully performed during 2017-2018, as part of the NASA PR Space Grant project entitled “DNS of crossflow jets subject to very strong favorable pressure gradient” by Mr. C. Quinones (graduate student) and Dr. Araya (advisor). The analysis was done by prescribing accurate turbulent information (instantaneous velocity and temperature) at the inlet of a computational domain for simulations of spatially-developing turbulent boundary layers. The major achievements and dissemination were: one MSc thesis proposal, three oral presentations, one peer-reviewed conference proceedings article, and, two journal papers in progress. The large and extensive DNS dataset generated (of approximately1.5TB in size) will be postprocessed and analyzed for turbulence modeling purposes and for the objective study of turbulent coherent structures, i.e. Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). The main research objectives of the proposed continuation project are two-fold. The first goal involves performing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of spatially-developing turbulent boundary layers subject to the combined effect of a crossflow jet at different velocity ratios (VR = 0.5 and 1) and streamwise favorable pressure gradient with passive scalar transport. The second goal consists on a better understanding of the physics behind momentum/scalar Lagrangian coherent motions emanating from crossflow jets.\n",

      "The UT Horizon Fund recently invested $150,000 to fund Cardiovate, a San Antonio-based startup that is using technology from two University of Texas System institutions to commercialize a medical device to treat vascular diseases by repairing blood vessels.\n",
      "The UT Horizon Fund â a formative-stage venture fund created by the UT Board of Regents that provides capital and support to companies with tangible ties to one of UT Systemâs 14 academic and health institutions â initially invested $50,000 in seed money for the company in 2013.\n",
      "âCardiovateâs disruptive technology will improve outcomes for patients who suffer from vascular diseases such as peripheral artery disease,â said Julie Goonewardene, UT System associate vice chancellor for innovation and strategic investment and managing director of the UT Horizon Fund. âThe UT Horizon Fund continues to support the companyâs efforts to move its life-saving medical device from the laboratory to the bedside.â\n",
      "Jordan Kaufmann, when she was a student at UTSA in 2012\n",
      "Cardiovate CEO Mark Standeford said having the UT Horizon Fund as an investment partner brings credibility and will help attract other investors to his company.\n",
      "Cardiovateâs medical device was developed by Jordan Kaufmann, Ph.D., while she was a graduate student at UTSAâs College of Engineering, along with her faculty advisers Mauli Agrawal, UTSA interim provost and vice president for academic affairs, and Steven Bailey, M.D., division chief for cardiology at UT Health Science Center San Antonioâs School of Medicine.\n",
      "âVascular disease is a progressive and life-threatening condition,â Standeford said. âOur technology will help those patients suffering from it who rely on synthetic bypass grafts for treatment. Current synthetic grafts oftentimes fail to perform well in long-term applications, requiring patients to undergo additional surgeries to treat the condition, or in some cases, they must undergo an amputation.â\n",
      "Cardiovateâs graft â made from a biodegradable material that can be absorbed by the body after use â is designed to support the bodyâs own healing process to develop new vascular tissues over time. The three-dimensional architecture and distinct surfaces of the graft will enable the growth of a patientâs own cells. The graft will be used for surgical repairs of blood vessels for peripheral artery disease and below-the-knee surgical applications.\n",
      "Standeford said the UT Horizon Fundâs latest investment will help Cardiovate execute the next phase of research to conduct long-term studies and show improved results from its grafts compared to other current devices.\n",

      "âI love math, especially geometry, so I want to build bridges and work with transportation,â he said.\n",
      "Until he graduates, though, heâll remain a part of the football team as a student assistant. As practices began this summer, Bogenschutz was there daily to support his coaches and teammates in every way he could.\n",
      "âIâm working the new quarterbacks and helping out wherever the coaches need me,â he said. âI feel like Iâm doing more learning than anything.â\n",
      "The team is made up of upperclassmen heâs familiar with as well as fresh students recruited by the new head football coach, Frank Wilson. According to Bogenschutz, energy is high going into the new season, and a lot of that has to do with Coach Wilson.\n",
      "âHeâs doing a great job of getting everyone pumped up,â he said. âIâve been able to work with him a bit more closely than I would have if I was still a player, and heâs a great leader.\n",
      "He does a great job of explaining things so that everyone knows what they need to do and how to do it. From the beginning, it was clear he was going to be a great asset.â\n",
      "Aside from game tips, Bogenschutz has been advising the new players to manage their time wisely and balance their course load properly.\n",
      "âThatâs how we are,â he said. âNot just on the team but at UTSA. Weâre like a small town in a big city. Weâre a family.â\n",

      "Castillo, GreenStar Endowed Assistant Professor in Energy, received about $1.6 million in grants and has support more than 27 college students and 23 community college students since the inception of the programs.\n",
      "âInternships are a great way to conduct hands-on research and promote an education that is centered on the learner. I encourage our students to work on the theoretical aspects of their research during the academic semester and conduct summer internships at national laboratories to gain knowledge and understanding of the operational complexity of sustainable energy systems from source-to-use and collect first-hand data,â said Castillo. âI have observed that after the summer internships, the students become more articulated about the impact and significance of their research and how their project is aligned to a national priority. The success stories are many and varied. For example, Andres Tapia and Alex Lara (ME) just published a journal paper from their 2015 internship project; great accomplishment of our Roadrunners!â\n",

She avidly reads the latest peer reviewed work on college students and matches the appropriate technological tools to courses she designs with an eye to highlight and celebrate the diversity of our nation. In 2015 she was honored with the UTSA President’s Distinguished Teaching Award for Teaching Excellence.\n",

      "Jorge Felipe-Gonzalez earned his B.A., Magna Cum Laude, in History from the University of Havana and his Ph.D. in History from Michigan State University. His book in progress, The Slave-Trading Mafia: Transatlantic Networks and the Foundation of the Cuban-based Slave Trade, the result of over a decade of research with multilingual sources from Cuba, Spain, Sierra Leone, the United Kingdom, and the United States, uncovers the emergence of Cuba as a leading transatlantic slave-trading region in the Americas as a result of domestic changes in the island and the post-abolitionist rearrangement of trans-Atlantic trading networks and routes. Although rooted in Cuba, the scope of the book is fundamentally Atlantic. It traces the relocation of American slave traders to Cuba after 1808 as a critical factor for the formation of the slave-trading machinery on the island, details the constitution of new transatlantic slave trading corridors during the nineteenth century, and concludes with the socio-political effects of the expansion of the Cuban slave trade in some African communities.\n",
      "Jorge Felipe-Gonzalez has worked on several digital projects on slavery, such as the Transatlantic and Intra-American Slave Trade Databases and, as a Mellon Fellow at the DuBois Institute at Harvard University, on the People of the Transatlantic Slave Trade (PAST). He has been awarded several grants, such as the International Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World and, together with other colleagues, an Australian Research Council Grant to develop a new digital database on the Trans-Pacific Slave Trade. Some of Felipe-Gonzalez’s undergraduate and graduate courses are “History of U.S./Latin American Relations,” “Teaching and Researching the Transatlantic Slave Trade in the Digital Age,” “Slavery and its Legacy in the Digital Age,” “Everyday Life under a Totalitarian State,” and “From Colonial to totalitarian Cuba: 500 years of History.”\n",

      "I grew up in Austin and graduated with a B.A. in History from U.T.-Austin. In 1992 I received my Ph.D. from New York University, under the direction of Thomas Bender. Before coming to UTSA in 1997, I served as Lecturer in Social Studies at Harvard College and as a Visiting Professor of History at Tufts University. At Harvard, I was awarded an award for excellence in teaching. My first book, Creating a National Home: Building the Veterans' Welfare State, 1860-1900 (Harvard University Press, 1998), focuses on the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, the direct bureaucratic precursor to today’s Veterans Health Administration. My article, \"The Election of 1896 and the Restructuring Civil War Memory,\" (Civil War History, September 2003), examines the Republican Party's deployment of Civil War memory in its effort to defeat William Jennings Bryan. My research now focuses on the interconnections between the Civil War and the French intervention in Mexico. My article, “The North American Crisis of the 1860s,”(Journal of the Civil War Era, September 2012) argues that the U.S. Civil War and French intervention should be framed from a continental perspective. My article, \"The European Revolutions of 1848 and the Transnational Turn in Civil War History\" (Journal of the Civil War Era, September 2014) examines recent histories that embed the Civil War within global history. My essay, \"The Cat's Paw, Confederate Ambitions in Latin America,\" appears in American Civil Wars: The United States, Latin America, Europe and the Crisis of the 1860s (UNC Press, 2017). This article argues that the slave South lost its capacity to expand territorially in the Western Hemisphere once it left the Union. My essay, \"The Lost Continent of Abraham Lincoln\" (The Journal of the Civil War Era, June 2019), argues that Abraham Lincoln was thinking of the Civil War hemispherically when he utilized the ideologically loaded word \"continent: in the first line of the Gettysburg Address. With Rhonda Minten, I edited a collection of primary documents, Living on the Edge: Texas During the Civil War and Reconstruction(Cognellla Press, 2015). My book, The Lost Continent of Abraham Lincoln (LSU, forthcoming) examines republicanism in the New World during the crisis of the 1860s. I have received a Charles A. Ryskamp Research Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, an “Extending the Reach” fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and two Faculty Development Leaves from the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n",
      "I teach courses (both undergraduate and graduate) on the Civil War and World War II, the introductory graduate Theories and Methods class, and the Proseminar-Seminar capstone M.A. course. I also teach both halves of the undergraduate U.S. survey, Texas History, Historical Methods, and the Senior Seminar in History.\n",

My first book, Labor and Love in Guatemala: The Eve of Independence, shows how gender and family relations contributed to the erosion of both Indigenous draft labor and African slavery in the late colonial period. Currently, I am writing a book about native marriage, migration, and activism in colonial Mexico and Guatemala. My work has been supported by fellowships from the American Association of University Women, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the University of California Humanities Research Institute. I am fluent in English and Spanish and have the basic reading ability in Nahuatl, Portuguese, and Russian. Before going to graduate school in history, I was a math teacher in Guatemala City.

      "Andrew Konove received his B.A., Magna Cum Laude, with High Honors in History from Haverford College and his M.A., M.Phil., and Ph.D. in History from Yale University, where he also received a Graduate Certificate of Concentration in Latin American Studies. His research focuses on the political, economic, and social history of urban Mexico and Spanish America in the late colonial and early national periods. His first book, Black Market Capital: Urban Politics and the Shadow Economy of Mexico City (University of California Press, 2018), traces the history of Mexico City’s infamous Baratillo marketplace from the seventeenth century to the present day, revealing the centrality of extralegal commerce to the city’s local economy and politics. It received the Social Science Book Prize from the Mexico Section of the Latin American Studies Association and was a finalist for the Business History Conference’s Hagley Prize. Dr. Konove is currently at work on two new projects: a history of money and monetary ideas in Mexico and Spanish America between 1750 and 1850, titled Making Change: Money, Wealth, and Sovereignty in Hispanic America, 1750-1850; and a history of Mexico City’s main public square—tentatively titled Zócalo: A History of Mexico City. He has published his research in the Journal of Urban History and The Americas. His writing has also appeared in the San Antonio Express-News and the foreign policy journal The National Interest. At UTSA, Dr. Konove teaches graduate and undergraduate courses on colonial and modern Latin American history and the history of the Spanish Empire.\n",

      "Gregg L. Michel, Professor of History, received a B.A. from the University of Chicago and an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Virginia. Dr. Michel's scholarly work focuses on movements for social change in post-World War II America, particularly in the 1960s South. He has published several articles and delivered numerous papers on this topic. His book, Struggle for a Better South: The Southern Student Organizing Committee, 1964-1969, examines the turbulent history of the bending progressive white student organizations in the 1960s South. He has also published a book titled Spying on Students: The FBI, Red Squads, and Investigations of Student Activists in the Civil Rights Era South, which focuses on government surveillance of civil rights and anti-Vietnam War activists in the South.\n",
      "His expertise in such content areas as the history of the civil rights movement and post-World War II southern and African-American history has helped to expand both the undergraduate and graduate program, and the diverse methodologies he employs in his research allow him to expose his students to a wide range of historical approaches, including the use of oral testimony to access the attitudes and beliefs of ordinary people in the past. Dr. Michel has taught Historical Methods for undergraduates and Introduction to History: Theory and Methods, a course that introduces students to the historian's craft through an examination of a variety of historical theories and methodologies. As a foundational course for graduate students, he seeks to expose students to numerous approaches to researching and understanding the past.\n",

I have been teaching history classes at UTSA since Spring 2011. I teach a variety of courses including Texas History, World Civilizations, American History: Pre-Columbian to Reconstruction, and American History: Reconstruction to the Present. In collaboration with my colleague, Dr. Patrick Kelly, I co-edited Living on the Edge: Texas During the Civil War and Reconstruction, a primary source supplemental text on Texas history during the Civil War era. It was published in 2015 by Cognella Publishing Company. I love studying history and teaching history. I believe that studying and understanding history is essential because we all create it, and we are all affected by it.\n",

Dr. Nolan-Ferrell's research interests are in migration, citizenship, and national identity in Modern Mexico and Guatemala, as well as the history of gender in Latin America. Her book, Constructing Citizenship: Transnational Workers and Revolution on the Mexico-Guatemala Border, 1880-1950, (the University of Arizona Press, 2012), focuses on how laborers who worked in the coffee industry along the Guatemalan/Mexican border developed an understanding of nationality, particularly after the implementation of agrarian reforms in the late 1930s.\n",
      "Her current book project, Migrants or Refugees? Violence and Forced Migration in Southern Mexico and Guatemala, 1950-2000 investigate the causes and impacts of Guatemalan migration into southern Chiapas. It addresses how nations, institutions, and individuals both shaped and responded to mass violence. By examining the historical contexts of forced migration, her research shows how impoverished indigenous workers from northwestern Guatemala who worked in Chiapas, Mexico, used direct and indirect knowledge of labor migration to seek safety. It also explores how migrants navigated social systems that defined them as necessary migrant workers, dangerous immigrants, or helpless refugees.\n",

She thought it would be a short break, but she never went back, instead working and volunteering outside her profession in a variety of areas. The jobs that provided the most useful skills? Marathon coaching and preschool teaching. After her children left home, Reichman returned to school to study what she should have studied in the first place: history. She obtained her master's degree in history from UTSA in 2023.

      "John F. Reynolds, Professor of History, acquired his B.A. and M.A. from Michigan State University and his Ph.D. from Rutgers University. He is a political historian specializing in the Gilded Age and Progressive Era in the United States. He has published two books and several articles addressing the regulation of political parties and the electoral process. His most recent essay, “The Hustling Candidate and the Advent of the Direct Primary,” appeared in the Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era (2013). His research has a social science approach and he has taught graduate courses in quantitative methods in history at UTSA as well as in the University of Michigan’s InterUniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research summer program. Reynolds also has had a longstanding interest in the use of multimedia in instruction dating back to his days as an editor of H-Net’s H-MMEDIA. He continues to experiment with internet based instruction. Recently he was the principle investigator on a four year grant for developing a hybrid version of the U. S. history survey to be taught partly on-line. He is also teaches courses in local and public history. Reynolds’ current research interests have shifted to historical demography where he delves into the baptismal and burial records of San Antonio’s San Fernando parish from 1780 to 1860.\n",

      "\n",
      "An institutional research training grant is an award that provides funding to support research training and education programs for trainees at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Training grants are an important source of support for research training programs, and help to ensure adequate numbers of highly trained scientists to assume leadership roles related to the Nation’s biomedical and behavioral research agenda. For National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded training grants, the focus of training activities can be in basic biomedical or clinical sciences, in behavioral or social sciences, in health services research, or in any other discipline relevant to the mission of NIH. Training grants provide support for stipends, tuition and fees, training-related expenses, and health insurance. Training grants are awarded to institutions, rather than individual researchers, and the institutions are responsible for overseeing the administration of the training program and selecting trainees who will participate. Training programs can include a variety of activities, such as research rotations, coursework, and mentored research projects. Training grants are usually awarded for a period of five years, and are renewable, subject to the availability of funding and demonstration of a strong program.\n",

      "- To enable institutions to recruit individuals selected by the program leadership for predoctoral and/or postdoctoral research training in specified scientific areas.\n",
      "- To provide individuals with research training during off-quarters or summer periods to encourage research careers and/or research in areas of national need.\n",
      "- These grants provide support for short-term research training programs, usually lasting one to two months, for high school, undergraduate, and medical students.\n",
      "- To support comprehensive interdisciplinary research training programs at the undergraduate, predoctoral and/or postdoctoral levels, by capitalizing on the infrastructure of existing multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research programs.\n",
      "- These grants provide additional funding to institutions to support the research training and education of individuals from underrepresented groups in health-related research.\n",
      "- To assist professional schools to establish, expand, or improve programs of continuing professional education, or refresher education dealing with new developments in the science of technology of the profession.\n",
      "- These grants provide support for research training programs for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees in areas of biomedical and behavioral research.\n",
      "- To enhance the undergraduate research training of individuals from groups underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral sciences through Institutional NRSA training grants, in preparation for research doctorate degree programs.\n",

      "Training the Trainer: A Mentoring Model to Increase Participation in Graduate and Postdoctoral Programs and the Workforce\n",
      "\n",
      "Best practices that have emerged from studies over the past few decades have led to important approaches in preparing undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students for success in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce. However, fewer studies have addressed student retention, successful degree completion, and preparation for careers or retention and success for graduates once placed in those careers. Although students are placed in appropriate positions, the culture of the employer and workplace is often not sufficiently supportive to affect the retention and success of the new employee. Therefore, this initiative aims to address these gaps: both in academic training and placement at the employment site. Thus, we propose a dual train-the-trainer mentoring model where: a) the educational institution and workplace work together to build a bridge from program to placement, and b) the student is trained to use the toolkit from this program to achieve success in their careers. This model will identify best practices for mentoring, engaging, retaining, and fostering student success to weave a rich tapestry workforce and promote excellence in effecting systemic change.\n",
      "We started this process with an alliance including a selected set of Minority Serving Institutions (New Mexico State University, the University of Texas at San Antonio, Tuskegee University, and Fort Valley State University) and one federal agency (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USFWS) to implement the model, identifying effective and ineffective aspects, and modifying the model as needed. While this is currently an agency-specific document, it is meant to be broadly applicable and adapted (and adaptable) as we scale up to include additional educational institutions and employers. We provide the basic framework to address issues we and others before us have thus far identified. We emphasize that this is a living document, meant to be built upon as we learn and continuously improve upon best practices and discard those ineffective in the local environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Broadening participation in STEM educational programs and the STEM workforce, which aligns with U.S. demographics, remains challenging, particularly in conservation and natural resource disciplines. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation funded a group of Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to survey the STEM participation landscape and, through a series of listening and learning workshop sessions, to produce guidance for best practices with regard to STEM programs and workplaces. This Alliance sought to build upon existing knowledge to change institutional culture by identifying, acknowledging, and overcoming these biases, opening the pathway to graduate education and the conservation workforce for underrepresented minorities. We sought to measure our impact and disseminate lessons learned to other STEM disciplines. Our project focuses on building networks of faculty from our partner MSIs and USFWS scientists. Our approach is two-fold, starting with identifying mentoring skills through a series of workshops.\n",
      "Forms\n",
      "Mentoring\n",
      "Representatives from all alliance members met, including current and former students, faculty, employers, and employees (several in multiple roles). We evaluated what we know (i.e., best practices in our respective institutions and agencies, including relevant literature) about developing science identity among underrepresented students, including feedback from students. Faculty and employer participants have all taught, mentored, and conducted research with URM STEM students. From this workshop, we developed an agenda and selected experts to correct what we, as faculty and employers, don’t know about building science identity and facilitating student and later employee success.\n",
      "As a pilot, we matched students with mentors for summer research experiences. We followed students participating in various internship and fellowship programs, including partnerships with the US Fish and Wildlife Services, US Forest Service, US Department of Agriculture, Student Conservation Association, and the Chicago Field Museum. We assess the students' and mentors' experiences and attitudes with formative and summative evaluations. Data was collected from students before (survey), during (collected writing and communication deliverables), and after (focus groups) participation to determine satisfaction, skill acquisition, science identity, and sense of belonging.\n",
      "A key feature of the summer experience was a network of mentoring support that included paired peer-to-peer mentoring, as well as designated faculty and professional mentoring personnel. Findings from the data collected emphasized the value of this networked approach to support as students were able to receive targeted support for different areas of disciplinary expertise, communications, and community engagement, while students also provided one another with invaluable self-reflection and confidence building. Students described their ability to work across professional contexts and with different professional and social contexts as being central to their ability to refine disciplinary expertise and helped them feel that they belonged and had valuable contributions to make to science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "- Be prepared to mentor trainees in both formal and informal ways for multiple career paths. Faculty should take advantage of institutionally provided mentoring training, such as micro-credentials and encourage their mentees to seek such opportunities as well. Resources for mentors and mentees listed below include CIRTL, NCFDD, CIMER-NRMN, and Nature MasterClass.\n",
      "- Seek feedback from alumni working in non-academic careers to identify what knowledge, skills, and abilities developed in training have best served them in their positions and areas in which they wish they had received more training.\n",
      "- Provide incentives and recognition for faculty engaging in training focused on effective mentorship and providing professional development (PD) for students and/or encouraging their students’ participation in PD activities.\n",
      "- Institution-wide programming should be implemented to create an environment that facilitates early professional relationship-building with potential trainees and networking opportunities for students and trainers.\n",
      "- Provide professional development opportunities for students to facilitate interdisciplinary networking and peer mentor relationships with graduate students in varying stages of their academic program.\n",
      "- Train employees to mentor, including setting expectations.\n",
      "- Partner with educational institutions to share best practices and desired professional skills.\n",
      "- Paid internships\n",
      "- Pairing interns with seasoned employees who can provide guidance and support\n",
      "- Having inexperienced intern supervisors shadow experienced supervisors\n",
      "- Pairing interns to reduce their anxiety\n",
      "- Evaluate and Iterate\n",
      "- Promote Accountability and Recognition\n",
      "- Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing\n",
      "- Ensure sustainability and scalability\n",
      "- Create space for students’ contributions—students have a story about why they are here, who/where their communities are—and be intentional in implementing recommendations when feasible.\n",
      "- Ask for help\n",
      "- Ask for resources\n",
      "- Make a and b part of the accepted culture, potentially through peer mentoring\n",
      "- Include families. Share the importance and value of postgraduate training and multiple career paths in science to the broader society, emphasize the importance of providing support for the decision to pursue a degree\n",

While primary emphasis on language and literacy is in Spanish the children also develop their English literacy skills via websites, YouTube videos, computer games, and apps. The experience for UTSA teacher candidates provides them access and training for the latest technology and an understanding of how these innovative devices can be effectively used as a mediator to develop language and literacy for young bilingual students.\n",

The programs established and implemented through TALC assists students to complete their teaching certification and degree program by addressing academic, emotional, and psychosocial challenges a university experience may bring. TALC is a model for increasing the number of Latino, ethnically diverse, and low-income students pursuing teacher certification in the critical shortage areas and STEM-related fields.

      "After Iowa State, I went to Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, where I was a team lead for the Information Design Assurance Red Team (IDART) and then their Cooperative Adversarial Security Assessments (CASA) team.\n",
      "I moved to San Antonio in July 2021 since Sandia has partnership with UTSA through the NSCC. In January 2022, I jumped over to UTSA as an Associate Professor of Practice. In addition to teaching Cyber Security classes, I also coach our cybersecurity competition teams.\n",
      "- Electric Vehicle Charging: Researching the cybersecurity vulnerabilities related to EV charging – vehicle, charger, and cloud systems – and identifying risks to operations and the power grid.\n",
      "- New Jersey Transit: NJT was given a grant to create an electrical microgrid that will allow trains in the New York City and New Jersey region to continue operating in the event of a widespread outage such as that caused by Superstorm Sandy. The goal for my research team was to discover potential vulnerabilities from the system design and develop solutions that could be integrated into the system as it was built.\n",
      "I also make sure to work with them on managing their performance, both individually and as a team. This means making sure they are watching out for each other and working as a team. This includes watching each other to make sure everyone is taking breaks and not getting overwhelmed by the high-stress, and fast-paced competition environment. It also means that they work together, understand mistakes will happen, but they need to work through the issues and fix them instead of blaming someone for making a mistake.\n",
      "For most competitions, the coach is not allowed contact with their students – this prevents faculty from being \"too helpful\" during the competition. So, once the competition starts, the coaches are usually put in a separate area. Which makes for a great collaboration opportunity. For this past competition I was also responsible for getting the pizza from the front desk to the students since they were working on their assessment report late into the night.\n",

      "QuEST is one of the highly competitive NSF-funded Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI), and is currently in Phase 1, which includes three years of funding. The guiding principle of QuEST is to develop a new method to alter the reaction selectivity that is based on quantum phenomena, and enable chemical transformations that are not currently possible.\n",

He was hired by UTSA in 2016 and is currently undergoing his tenure review. Large was recently involved in a research project by the Army Research Office to investigate the fundamental optical and photothermal properties of hybrid nanomaterials, which holds practical applications in cancer photothermal therapy and high-density data storage devices.\n",

Tonzetich's research focuses on synthetic inorganic chemistry with applications in biology and homogeneous catalysis. His current major research emphasis is on the catalytic mechanisms of earth-abundant transition metals. This project is primarily funded by the Welch Foundation and examines the roles that metal ions play in important organic reactions such as hydrogenation and hydroboration.\n",

      "Dr. Mariah Hopkins has been chased by an ostrich, had her lunch stolen by a baboon and came eye-to-eye with a 40-ton humpback whale–all in the name of research. Before joining the College of Sciences, she taught courses at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Texas at Austin, and she developed field biology training programs and conservation programs in the U.S. and Central America. She spent two years studying several species of monkeys at a remote tropical forest site in Panama that was accessible only by boat. She has also conducted research on African wildlife while living in the savanna in a thatched-roof hut with no electricity or running water.\n",
      "Hopkins now brings that adventurous spirit to her classroom. \"Biology is the study of life, and to me there is no greater mystery,\" she said. \"I get to spend my day figuring out how life works and teaching students about the amazing life forms on this planet and the underlying processes that make that life possible.\"\n",
      "The majority of her previous research focused on understanding and predicting animal space-use patterns and the implications of those patterns for human-wildlife conflict and disease spread. Now, she is developing a research program that evaluates the effectiveness of innovative instructional technologies and pedagogical techniques for STEM education. In 2020, she initiated a research project comparing the impact of different virtual lab formats on learning outcomes for introductory biology students. This project is part of ongoing efforts to improve experiential learning opportunities for students in large-format science courses.\n",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hopkins has embraced innovative technologies such as simulations, case studies, biointeractives and virtual labs to engage students and provide additional experiential learning opportunities. In Fall 2020, she partnered with Academic Innovation to implement this experiential learning model in her non-majors Introductory Biology class, and she has since expanded the model to several other courses. The model is hugely successful; students report that they learned more, felt more engaged, were excited about the material and could see the real-world value of content more easily than in traditional class formats.\n",
      "In recognition of her ongoing efforts to improve the academic experience for students, Hopkins was recently awarded the President's Distinguished Achievement Award for Core Curriculum Teaching. The award recognizes faculty who expertly implement UTSA's core curriculum focus, including the development of critical-thinking skills, communication skills, empirical and quantitative skills, and teamwork in their courses.\n",
      "\"It is incredibly rewarding to see my students succeed,\" she said. \"That success can be something as simple as students making connections between content and their daily lives. It can be students working through a problem and developing a newfound confidence in their abilities or identifying as scientists for the first time. It can also happen after college, when students are able to market the skills that they have learned in class to land internships, jobs and admission to graduate school. Witnessing the impact of my courses on my students' college and career trajectories is one of the greatest rewards I have experienced as a teacher.\"\n",

      "I continued my interdisciplinary training as a postdoctoral researcher at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee in the lab of Professor Fred Guengerich, whose lab was the first to isolate and characterize four of the five major drug metabolizing P450 enzymes in humans. With these valuable experiences as a trainee, UTSA had a posting for an assistant professor in 2015, who would be expected to carry out research at the interface of chemistry and biology and also by employing a technique called mass spectrometry. I felt that I was a perfect match for the opening and I reached out to my contact, Professor Doug Frantz, who was actually one of my thesis committee members in grad school and moved to UTSA in 2009.\n",
      "I expanded on the initial paper by updating the research that had been done since the original publication in May 2020. Many researchers all over the world had heroically continued the work to investigate SARS CoV-2 proteins so that we can finally put an end to this devastating situation. I published a recent update on the SARS CoV-2 proteins in February 2021 to attempt to summarize some of the global effort to understand SARS CoV-2 into one document. Summarizing everything is impossible since March 2021 there have been 111,964 documents on the topic of COVID-19 published according to the National Library of Medicine. I also made some more sequence comparisons and other structural alignments to provide new insights in the update in February. In the end, I hope that these efforts will help us the next time this happens.\n",
      "There are a handful of students that I had the privilege of being able to teach this way in the lab setting, but the end result is so rewarding. To be able to see the excitement and the gratitude of the student is priceless. The student's enthusiasm for the subject grows and their positivity is contagious. I often realize that the work that the student is doing is that of the work of a team of scientists, who already have PhDs. In our case, the student is often an undergrad at UTSA!\n",

      "\"I love teaching,\" says Dr. Vallines Mira. \"I really like the ah-ha moments, the moments when you see the lightbulbs coming out of their heads.\" Dr. Vallines Mira studied math in Spain and Finland, with the original goal of becoming a mathematician. \"I realized halfway through that maybe math alone was not enough, so I minored in education and fell in love with it,\" she explains. Dr. Vallines Mira next pursued her Ph.D. in Math Education in Montana, where she worked with teachers on Native American reservations. When she returned to Spain, her advisor from Montana called. His new job was to rebuild the math education program at UTSA and he wanted Dr. Vallines Mira to help. That was six years ago.\n",
      "Today, Dr. Vallines Mira is a Lecturer 3 in the Department of Mathematics. She coordinates and teaches math content courses for future elementary teachers. \"How the students see math when they come in and how they see it when they come out is really interesting,\" she says. \"Our goal is not to just teach them new things but to unveil the conceptions they have and see how that affects what they learn and how they teach it.\" For example, her classes add, subtract and multiply in base five instead of base ten. This takes students out of their comfort zone. \"When they come back to base ten, they see it with a whole different set of eyes,\" she says.\n",
      "Dr. Vallines Mira also collaborates with her colleagues to conduct research that helps them build and improve their lessons while studying their own approach to learning. \"I believe math educators are life-learners,\" says Dr. Vallines Mira. \"This process is helping us focus the conversation instead of just talking about learning in general.\" The group's goal is to create mindfully designed lessons, based on their combined experience and supported by research findings, that they can share with new colleagues. \"It's both practical in the way that we are building good lessons and on the other hand we are learning about ourselves and hopefully becoming better educators,\" she says.\n",

In addition to her instructional duties, she is the SACS (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) coordinator and the undergraduate biochemistry advisor.\n",

      "\"I don't like lecturing to blank screens,\" she said. \"The biggest challenge [right now], is when I teach to a classroom, I can see where they understand and where they are completely lost. Now, it's a big struggle to understand how to engage the students. I truly miss that interaction.\"\n",
      "Thomas originally studied chemistry because she wanted to perform cancer research. After college, she worked in a natural products chemistry lab before returning to Texas to work in a molecular biology lab. She then earned her doctoral degree in protein folding and thermodynamics, which led her to work in an x-ray crystallography lab.\n",

      "My initial plan was law school but after leaving the army as a medic I decided to get my BSN. Well...about halfway through nursing school I decided that was not for me, but I remembered taking my first chemistry class while getting my pre-requisites for nursing. I remembered how much I liked it and decided to switch my major to chemistry. The rest, as they say, is history. I earned my B.S. and M.S. at UTSA and was hired to teach the Organic II labs to replace the old coordinator. At first I did this while searching for a job in industry, but I liked teaching so much I decided to make a career out of it.\n",

      "One project involves using static program analysis to detect privacy leaks in video captured by augmented reality apps. For example, if you use Google Translate's live translation feature on your phone, it sends the text it captures to Google's servers for translation. If there is any private text in the background (e.g., prescriptions, phone numbers, etc), that may get sent too. My work tries to identify and potentially mitigate those risks.\n",
      "Another project involves using artificial intelligence to link source code with natural language to help detect when an app violates its own privacy policy. For example, if a privacy policy states something like, \"We do not collect your location information,\" my framework can understand that and then use program analysis over the app to verify whether that is true. So far, this work has found dozens of potential privacy policy violations in top apps.\n",
      "I'm also working to automatically identify potential defects or vulnerabilities in apps by using machine learning to treat source code as natural language. The model identifies risks in the same way you might use context when reading a book to make guesses about what is going to happen next.\n",

      "Jeff Jackson's journey to UTSA started over 30 years ago when he attended UTSA's field biology course with Dr. Van Auken and Dr. Bush. \"That more than anything influenced my professional career,\" he says. \"It changed my life.\" After a rewarding career teaching high school science, Jeff returned to UTSA to earn his master's degree. He now advises about 350 undergraduate students in addition to teaching environmental zoology and oceanography and co-leading the field biology class each summer. Jeff is also UTSA's head beekeeper. He wrote a grant in collaboration with Dr. Beckham that allows undergraduate students to research honeybees and related pollinators on campus. This March, the first two students will present their research at the Entomological Society of America's annual conference in Oklahoma City. \"I was given this opportunity to apply for some money and my thought was, how can I use this to make our students better scientists? A lot of these students don't realize they are capable of doing research,\" Jeff says. \"They just need someone to encourage them.\"\n",
      "Vonnie Jackson was originally hired in 2013 to write curriculum for the Environmental Science Program, which is now the Environmental Science and Ecology Department. Vonnie has taught many different courses in the years since, including botany and zoology classes. She also coordinated and taught the corresponding labs. \"I love plants,\" she says. \"Everything depends on plants. Students don't know as much about plants as animals, so it's fun to introduce them to some of the unique things that plants do.\" She enjoys watching students flourish as many grow from students to student tutors. \"It's kind of neat you have students in your class and then they are working as tutors for the next generation of students,\" Vonnie says. \"I've noticed that a lot more of those student tutors think more about getting a graduate degree. We give them a lot of responsibility and they do well with it.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "By Valerie Bustamante Johnson\n",
      "Long gone are the days where San Antonio caregivers of people with special needs and disabilities are on their own to figure out which services they need, when they need them, and how to fit it all into their schedules.\n",
      "Morgan’s Multi-Assistance Center (Morgan’s MAC) has a new way forward for families with coordinated care among more than 30 community partners, providing what they call “Ultra-Accessible” services for anything from speech therapy to legal services, and even dental care and eye exams.\n",
      "“An individual with disabilities — especially if they are diagnosed in their early childhood — may go to different therapies that are all over the city,” says Leslie Neely, associate professor in educational psychology at UTSA and director of the UTSA Child and Adolescent Policy Research Institute. “Often times caregivers can’t work full-time because they spend so much time navigating services and taking them to different appointments. Morgan’s MAC will improve the health and quality of life for these individuals and their caregivers.”\n",
      "Erica Sosa, associate dean for research success, professor of public health and co-director of the UTSA Center for Community Based and Applied Health Research and Neely, who is also the associate director of the UTSA Brain Health Consortium, are determined to help members of Morgan’s MAC succeed by helping evolve and streamline their services.\n",
      "“We formed the Evaluation and Research Coordinating Center (ERCC), in which UTSA is the leading community partner, to perform an external evaluation of the Morgan’s MAC Care Model and lead innovative research efforts,” Neely says.\n",
      "The Morgan’s MAC Care Model consists of team members, also known as MAC Navigators, serving as single points of contact for families. The Navigators guide caregivers to service providers and track the children’s progress and their follow-ups through an electronic platform called MACNav.\n",
      "This new groundbreaking system has promise to become a model for others across the country who are seeking to serve people with disabilities and special needs. The ERCC will be the primary group to evaluate the effectiveness of Morgan’s MAC and help share findings with the larger community.\n",

      "Through the partnership, UTSA is also currently providing severe behavior support as part of the autism committee at Morgan’s MAC, which Neely leads.\n",
      "“One of the things that was clear early on, and not a surprise to me, was the need for severe behavior support,” Neely says. “Severe behavior can be very difficult for caregivers to navigate and it just so happened that we were at the right place at the right time to help fill this.\n",
      "In the Severe Behavior Lab, the researchers are analyzing the client’s behavior on a microscopic level for two hours a week as part of behavioral analyst therapy.\n",
      "“I believe that there is no such thing as a ‘bad’ kid. Kids may be aggressive or destructive because they are trying to communicate a want or a need, or perhaps discomfort or pain,” Neely says. “To help with this issue, we conduct our assessment to figure out what they are trying to communicate. We take observational data, graph it, and make a conclusion or translation of what their behavior means for them. Then we design an intervention that is tailored to them. Often times we are looking at making their communication more effective, more efficient and easier than the problematic behavior.”\n",

      "Research in my lab focuses on how aquatic organisms use the physical environment throughout their lifecycle and how human land use within watersheds impacts aquatic organisms through alterations to the physical environment. As one example, water development in desert environments often modifies the flow and sediment regime of streams and rivers, which in turn modifies channel habitat and water quality. Understanding how aquatic organisms are affected by altered flow and associated impacts will require research into their habitat needs and sensitivity to water quality changes, as well as their interactions within aquatic and riparian food webs.\n",
      "We also study how to best mitigate and reverse watershed impacts through river and stream restoration. An important goal in river restoration is to recover a dynamic, self-sustaining ecosystem. Accomplishing this goal requires an understanding of the physical processes that alter river and riparian habitat and how the life history cycle of aquatic organisms has adapted to these dynamic physical processes.\n",
      "A major goal of my lab's research is to inform how to manage landscapes to protect and restore the health of aquatic ecosystems, including conservation of aquatic biodiversity.\n",

Outside of my work and academic commitments, some hobbies I enjoy consist of photography, edm music, and volleyball. My future plans are to keep expanding my horizons on self discovery and live more spontaneously. I became a part of the HONEY Pathway to Medicinal Properties of Honey because it presented a unique learning opportunity unlike any other course I have taken. One of my interests lies in delving deeper into natural treatments and herbal medicine, bridging traditional knowledge with modern science as well as how health disparities impact our healthcare systems. In my research project, I will be studying the antimicrobial efficacy of various Texan honeys on bacteria growth for potential therapeutic applications.\n",

      "The Role of Channel Instability on the Storage and Release of Seeds for Tree Biodiversity\n",
      "\n",
      "Riparian zones, as interfaces between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, are some of the most diverse, complex, and dynamic habitats on the terrestrial Earth and are particularly sensitive to environmental change (Gregory et al., 1991; Malanson, 1993; Naiman et al., 1993; Naiman et al., 1997). One factor that contributes to high plant species diversity in riparian zones is periodic disturbances, particularly flood events (Wissmar and Swanson, 1990; Gregory et al., 1991; Naiman and Decamps, 1997; Pollock et al., 1998). However, this same type of disturbance is thought to facilitate invasive plant species establishment in these habitats (Stohlgren et al., 1998; Hood and Naiman, 2000). Invasive plant species can threaten biodiversity (Dukes and Mooney, 1999; Chapin et al., 2000), potentially impacting the productivity and stability of the ecosystem (Tilman, 2000).\n",
      "The aim of this research is to examine potential changes in native and invasive vegetation along the Little Tennessee River in North Carolina as a result of predicted changes in the hydrologic regime and channel instability due to climate change.\n",

      "Riparian forest ecosystems once-dominated by eastern hemlock have undergone fundamental changes in function and composition from infestations of hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA). Eastern hemlock and rosebay rhododendron often co-occur in these riparian forests, with rhododendron forming a dense shrub layer that strongly attenuates light incident on the forest floor, having little to no herbaceous or seedling cover below its canopy, negatively affecting tree seedling densities where they can establish, and decreasing nitrogen availability in the soil and litter layer. Thus, removal of rhododendron may be critical to restoring riparian areas affected by eastern hemlock loss.\n",
      "Scientists at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CHL), Southern Research Station, are conducting rhododendron removal experiments in riparian corridors once dominated by eastern hemlock.This involves removing rhododendron subcanopies and litter layers from degraded riparian forests to evaluate the barriers to ecosystem recovery. The experiments are designed to investigate restoration potential and methods in these degraded areas.\n",
      "As part of this larger study, we plan to investigate the potential contribution of the soil seed bank to regenerating these treated riparian areas. We will assess the quantity and the species richness of the soil seed bank in rhododendron and non-rhododendron plots within the larger study sites. In addition, we would look at seed persistence of rhododendron, as well as dominant woody and herbaceous species in rhododendron and non-rhododendron plots.\n",

      "Using Field Based Study of Nutrient Fluxes into Riparian Forests for Graduate Training\n",
      "\n",
      "Acidic deposition in the northeastern United States has been causing the soil to lose important nutrients. When the soil pH is too low, nutrients like calcium and magnesium are washed away. One way in which nutrients are put back into the soil is when leaves and dead plant material break down and decompose. In some cases, if the soil is severely depleted of these important nutrients and is too acidic, forest managers will choose to apply lime to the soil. Lime contains calcium which can help lessen the effects of soil acidity.\n",
      "My study will look at the time it takes leaf litter to break down in soils with varying levels of acidity and depleted nutrients. I will also look at the nutrients contained in the leaf material as the leaves break down. In addition, I will examine the effects of lime on the rate of litter decomposition. To do this, I have set up plots in the field containing bags of litter sewn into mesh bags. Some have been treated with lime and others have been left to decompose naturally. Periodically I will collect the bags and analyze them to determine the rate of decomposition and nutrient levels.\n",
      "To my knowledge, there are no field studies that look at litter decomposition after the application of lime. It is also unclear whether leaves break down more slowly or quickly than they naturally would in acidic soils. With my study, I hope to contribute information to the scientific community and forest managers on the effects of liming on litter decomposition and rates of decomposition in soils with different acidity and nutrient loss.\n",

      "Recovery of Forested Hilltops Impacted by Fire\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, southwestern ponderosa pine forests were open and park-like with large pine trees, a healthy grass cover on the forest floor, and a low abundance of small trees or underbrush. In addition, prior to Euro-American settlement (1870-1890), frequent, low-intensity fires occurred in these ecosystems every 2-20 years. Due to different human activities, exclusion of fire and lack of other disturbances, the historical structures of some of these forests has been greatly altered. Present day characteristics of these forests include: increased tree mortality, irruption of insects and diseases, a decrease in herbaceous plant and shrub quantity, and higher fuel loads. These conditions encourage fires that burn at intense and detrimental temperatures rather than more moderate temperatures which promote forest health. There is a lot of research being done to understand how restore these ecosystems back to their healthy historical structures.\n",
      "My project will be focused on how wildfire severity affects the seeds buried in the soil and what consequences this has for vegetative regeneration in a southwestern Ponderosa pine forest. I will also be looking at the effects of soil erosion due to fire severity on the movement of seeds. The study area is located by the pueblo of Jemez, New Mexico in the Valles Caldera National Preserve and has recently experienced a fire (the Thompson Ridge Fire) of varying severities during the summer of 2013. The vegetation in the study area consists mostly of ponderosa pine forest, with smaller proportions of mixed conifer forests present on north-facing slopes and a variety of grasses and grass-like vegetation. Though numerous studies have characterized the soil seed bank in southwest ponderosa pine forests pre-fire and post fire, studies that have examined seed movement due to erosion, which could affect the regeneration of the vegetation, are lacking. The objectives of my study are to analyze how different fire severities and/or slopes affect how the soil seed bank in this ecosystem changes over time, the extent of post-fire erosion, how seeds are displaced due to post-fire erosion, and how these qualities and processes affect the regeneration of vegetation after a wildfire.\n",

      "\n",
      "Research conducted in a pen setting has identified HOGGONE® as an effective sodium nitrite based oral toxicant for feral swine, and related studies have identified feeder designs as feral swine specific delivery systems, outside of bear habitat. Though feral swine readily consumed HOGGONE® from open top troughs in pen trials, uncertainty remains as to how feral swine behavior will affect consumption and mortality rates in free range populations feeding from species specific delivery systems.\n",
      "Our team is conducting controlled free-range trials in a 121.5-ha pasture located on Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's Kerr Wildlife Management Area. Trials will be conducted with known densities of feral swine at 3 different levels (low: 1 sounder, medium: 2 sounders, and high: 3 sounders), and each density will be replicated 4 times over the course of one year. Simple computations of proportions of swine in each treatment which succumb to sodium nitrite poisoning will be the metrics of toxicant and delivery system efficacy.\n",
      "Behavior at feeders will be analyzed through three metrics indexed by imagery and video:\n",
      "- the amount of bait used\n",
      "- the amount of time spent feeding\n",
      "- the number of individuals which open the bait box vs. the number that access the bait\n",

      "\n",
      "This study will evaluate urban green spaces as habitats for native bees by sampling bee populations along an urbanization gradient in Central Texas. Green spaces located within urban landscapes may provide suitable habitats that are capable of supporting a large diversity of bee populations. However, variation in vegetation and landscape composition may influence bee assemblages. This study will explore the differences in bee diversity by sampling bees in urban green spaces surrounded by varying amounts of impervious cover.\n",
      "During the course of this study, we seek to answer these research questions:\n",
      "- What is the diversity of native bees within the Central Texas region?\n",
      "- Does native bee community composition, abundance, and species richness vary along an urbanization gradient?\n",
      "- Do vegetation and the composition of the landscape influence the use of urban green spaces by native bees?\n",
      "This study may inform future city planning and management decisions in San Antonio to conserve and promote urban bee diversity. More generally, this study will provide information on the impact of urban development on bee communities and offer a glimpse at the diversity of native bees in Central Texas.\n",

      "The Effect of Fire Severity on Soil Microbial Recolonization in a Recently Burned Ponderosa Pine Forest\n",
      "\n",
      "Soil microbes work in communities in order to preform necessary functions for soil health. Essentially, the microbes in the soil can be killed off by heat of fires and after a fire the structure of the community of microbes changes. For example, certain types of bacteria may return and recolonize the soil faster after fires than others. We want see how the community composition changes over time from immediately after the fire to a year after the fire.\n",
      "The high temperatures and length of time that the area is burning establishes fire severity classes. Our study looks at sites in both high and low severity as well as a unburned control group for comparison. We are particularly interested in monitoring the bacteria in soils that preform an important role in converting nitrogen to a usable form that plants need to grow.\n",

      "Comparing How the Season of Prescribed Burning Affects Herpetofauna and Small Mammal Populations in the Southern Appalachians\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, fires set by Native Americans and settlers played a pivotal role in shaping much of the Southern Appalachian forest. Traditionally fire was used by Native Americans to improve travel and game conditions, and later by settlers to improve pasturage for livestock. In the early 20th century, forest fires became viewed as destructive and were suppressed wherever possible thus promoting the buildup of fuels and enhancing the likelihood of wildfire. It has been only recently that the restoration of these disturbance dependent ecosystems with prescribed fire has become a primary management objective of forest managers. The application of fire during different growing seasons is one aspect of prescribed burning that requires further study in regards to its impact on restoring upland hardwood ecosystems, enhancing wildlife habitat, wildlife populations, and species diversity.\n",
      "My study is focused on comparing the effects of growing season (June-July) versus dormant season (January-March) prescribed burning on the herpetofauna and small mammal populations in the Southern Appalachians. To accomplish this, I have a total of nine sites consisting of two treatments plus one control, with three repetitions each. Each of these units contains two Y-array pitfall traps that are checked daily for herpetofauna during the summer months, and one week of small mammal trapping is conducted using Sherman traps to provide a sample of the population and species diversity of the area.\n",
      "Currently, I do not know of any study that has been done comparing the season of prescribed burning to changes in wildlife populations and species diversity. Because of this, it is unclear as to what differences, if any, will result from the comparison study of herpetofauna and small mammal populations and species diversity found in each treatment. My hope is that this study will provide more information to the forest service and scientific community as a whole on the effects of the seasonality of prescribed burnings impact on an ecosystems wildlife.\n",

      "Herpetofauna Response to Oak Regeneration Silvicultural Treatments\n",
      "\n",
      "Largely due to the cessation of human caused disturbance in the twentieth century, oak species in the Southern Appalachians have experienced widespread regeneration failure. Oak species are slow to mature and require a great amount of sunlight while growing into maturity. Many species rely either directly or indirectly on oaks due to their acorn (mast) production. With the loss of American Chestnut to blight, oak is now considered a keystone species in the Southern Appalachian ecosystem.\n",
      "This study is the second phase that will examine the longer term effects that three types of silviculture treatments designed for oak regeneration have on small mammals and herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians) that dwell in this ecosystem. The first treatment, implemented in 2009-10 and scheduled to be repeated in 2013-14, was a prescribed burning to eradicate fire-sensitive species that compete with new oak growth. The second treatment was an herbicide removal of most of the midstory trees in 2008. The goal of this is to increase light on the forest floor. The third treatment was a reduction of the overstory to 30 to 40 percent of the original basal area in 2010 followed by a prescribed fire in 2013-14. The goal of this treatment is to let in great amounts of sunlight while also removing competing fire sensitive species. Each treatment consists of five hectare plots with four replicates of each treatment. Control plots were also implemented for this study.\n",
      "In 2013 and 2014, the second phase of surveying small mammal and herpetofauna populations will take place. Animals are live caught in pitfall and funnel traps, identified, recorded, and released. This data will be analyzed for species abundance before and after treatment, changes in physiological condition, and age and sex measures of populations. The first phase of studying the effects on small mammals and herpetofauna took place in 2008, 2010, and 2011.\n",

      "Ron Crabb’s art is almost undetectable, yet it has been seen by millions. He is a matte painter for major Hollywood films, such as X-Men, The Bucket List, and Speed Racer, and it is a compliment to say his work is undetectable. As a matte painter, Ron’s role is to create imaginary scenes that look entirely real. Building on an early career in motion graphics, he has developed his incredible photorealistic style. He spent twenty years working with digital painting systems beginning well before the advent of Photoshop. Today, Ron uses a combination of Photoshop, CGI, photographs, and good old-fashioned painting skills to create stunningly realistic matte paintings, special visual effects, title sequences, and concept art for movies. He also creates fine art using the same set of skills. This installment of Creative Inspirations takes viewers a thousand miles from L.A. to Bainbridge Island, Washington to get a look at the career, work, and lifestyle of a man who escaped Hollywood only to master it at a distance.\n",

With a background in biology, Margo migrated to the world of graphic design, where she brought a unique, organic quality to logos, lettering, and identity design. Never one to live life passively, Margo has developed a love for competitive aerobatic flying in her own high-performance plane. This installment of Creative Inspirations takes viewers inside the studio, portfolio, and adrenaline-pumped lifestyle of this inspired and inspiring designer.\n",

      "Looking for a quick and nontechnical introduction to scrum? This course is just for you. Join the CEO of Scrum.org, Dave West, as he provides a practical, engaging introduction to how scrum is used as a way to deliver products with greater agility. The course will prepare you if you are new to scrum, help you when joining a scrum team, or simply help you find out if scrum is right for you and your next project. Explore what kinds of projects are best suited to use scrum, the difference between agile and traditional project management techniques, the importance of empiricism, and how to develop and maintain a product- and customer-focused mindset. Dave outlines the accountabilities and responsibilities of everyone on the scrum team, as well as the purpose of each step of the framework, from scrum events to scrum artifacts and beyond. An ideal fit for anyone new to scrum—including project managers, product managers, and cross-functional members of a product team—this course equips you with in-demand skills to put scrum into everyday practice in your role.\n",

They are responsible for this project and progress from learning techniques to having intimate knowledge and understanding of the science and ideas underlying their work. In the process, they develop a relationship with a research mentor who will be instrumental in writing recommendation letter needed for graduate school admission or beyond.

      "\n",
      "Attention remains a neurobiological mystery. Every day, we perceive a barrage of stimuli from the external world. Amazingly, despite this incomprehensible amount of information, animals determine which stimuli they will act upon (e.g., running toward the sound of a prey or running away from the sound of a predator). Such goal-directed behaviors are crucial dynamic links between sensory stimuli and motor actions. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate how projections from the region of the brain called the posterior parietal cortex to the auditory cortex that influence neuronal activity in the sensory auditory pathway and their implications in abnormal circuitry organization in neurodevelopmental disorder. We will use optogenetic and pharmacological approaches in our research to turn neurons 'ON' and 'OFF'. In doing so, we can observe and manipulate specific subsets of neurons at multiple levels: in slice preparations in vitro, and in anesthetized or awake, behaving animals in vivo. This approach allows us to quantitatively determine how specific subsets of neurons contribute to sensory processing and behavior.\n",

      "The Physiological and Biochemical Characterization of the Pathway Leading to the Production of Jasmonic Acid\n",
      "\n",
      "Plants under insect herbivore attack have evolved various mechanisms to counteract this threat. Among the measures plants undertake to survive with the least damage are the recognition of insect-derived elicitors, production of proteins that block digestion or disrupt intestinal tissue, and the production of defense-related secondary metabolites which directly or indirectly affect the herbivore performance. Lipid-derived compounds (oxylipins), which are activated by elicitors from the insect saliva, represent important signals in this process. However, little is known about the regulation of the pathway leading to the production of jasmonic acid (JA), the most important signal in plant defense against herbivorous insects. The discovery of green leafy volatiles, the green smell of plants, as a volatile signal that facilitates communication between plants shed new light on how plants respond to insect herbivore attack and prepare their defenses. The significance of these pathways is not limited to defense-related functions, but also plays an important role in developmental and other biotic and abiotic processes. The physiological and biochemical characterization of these pathways are major aspects of Dr. Engelberth's research. Besides the metabolic analysis of possible signaling compounds, the molecular regulation of these processes are the major subjects in his research program.\n",

Central to his research program is the mentorship and career development of underrepresented students and non-underrepresented students at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels. Students investigate sectors of cell biology regarding roles of ECM molecules in health and disease. Different cell types collaborate using receptor mediated inter- and intra-cellular signaling to control cellular synthesis of three dimensional proteinaceous ECMs in the creation, repair and regeneration of functional tissues.\n",
      "An overarching goal in Dr. LeBaron's research program is to better comprehend ECM roles in the regenerative process. One objective is to understand the biology of a proapoptotic ECM protein called BIGH3. His lab's research has shown that BIGH3 is important in the progression of diabetic complications in human renal, ocular and cardiovascular systems. Interestingly, a similar BIGH3 mechanism is intimately involved in human cancer progression, thus explaining his investigative probes of BIGH3 in diabetes and cancer. The lab has recently identified the BIGH3-derived signals that induce apoptosis. Moreover, they now have evidence that a specific cell-surface receptor is involved in the apoptotic pathway, and have linked the pathway to macrophages and TGF-β1. Immediate goals are to delineate the cytosolic pathway that propels BIGH3-mediated apoptosis, and identify targets for diabetic and cancer therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "The second interest of Dr. LeBaron's research program is in the field of tissue engineering. Previously the lab had generated human-equivalent skin and articular cartilage tissues ex vivo, that is, outside the body using a bioreactor. They are currently exploring the role that BIGH3 plays in generation of engineered tissues, and BIGH3's potential signaling to stem cell proliferation and differentiation in the context of tissue engineering applications. The lab collaborates with a team of cell biologists, biochemists and tissue engineers at UTSA, UT Health San Antonio, and UC Davis in order to best understand ECM and cellular interactions in healthy and diseased tissues.\n",

There is therefore an increasing demand of biosensors for sensitive, accurate and high throughput assays of critical biomolecular interactions. For measurements of small molecules and/or at low concentrations, biomolecular detection usually requires labeling (such as fluorescent tags). However, fluorescence based biosensing has certain limitations, because the conjugation of the fluorescence tags may alter or inhibit the functionality of the target molecules. Thus, tremendous effort has been devoted in recent years to the development of label-free detection techniques for monitoring the binding of analytes in their natural forms. Despite the fact that a variety of label-free biosensors have been invented, it is still challenging for real-time, label-free detection of small molecules due to limited sensitivity; one of the biggest technical issues encountered in most label-free methods.\n",

Our group has been pioneering the use of visible light to prompt conformational changes in proteins mediated by non-covalently docked dyes. The function of proteins is intimately related to their structure. The goal of these studies is to use the conformational changes to 1) better understand the relationship between function and structure of certain proteins and 2) prompt conformational changes capable to produce non-native (i.e., artificial) properties in proteins.

      "- Recommendations from TAs are not recommended.\n",
      "- If you have worked in or are working in a research laboratory (not a teaching lab), get a recommendation from the PI of the lab.\n",
      "- The better you know someone, the better your recommendation is likely to be. If you have any doubts that a person will evaluate you well, ask them whether they \"know you well enough to write a strong recommendation for you.\" People don't like writing bad recommendations and this way you give them an easy way to turn you down rather than writing a bad or very scanty recommendation. Realize, however, that even a scanty recommendation is better than not turning one in at all or not applying.\n",
      "- Ask your recommender as far in advance as possible - preferably two weeks at minimum. Good recommendations take some consideration and time to put together and your professors are very busy.\n",
      "- You will provide the name and email address of your recommender when you apply. Your recommender will receive an email inviting them to send in the recommendation.\n",
      "- If a faculty member doesn't know you very well but will work with you, you may assist them by helping them get to know you better. Set up an appointment and provide them with a letter detailing your future goals and the program to which you are applying, as well as a copy of your résumé/CV.\n",
      "- PhDs often need to be reminded and are not annoyed if you do it politely. Follow up with your recommenders to make sure that the letters are actually sent. The \"squeaky wheel gets the grease\" really works in this circumstance.\n",

      "\n",
      "- A research experience greatly enriches your undergraduate education. Student researchers are stretched intellectually and sharpen their problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication skills. They read the primary literature and become an expert in a topic within their field.\n",
      "- Student researchers also get to know a faculty member and have the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities. A strong letter of recommendation from a research mentor who has worked closely with a student is much more valuable than one from a course instructor.\n",
      "- Undergraduate researchers also have the opportunity to investigate their personal interests, develop marketable skills, and explore a high-level career. Research lays the foundations for the next step in a student's personal and professional development, and opens the doors to graduate education, professional programs, or competitive first-time jobs.\n",

      "If you are a UTSA undergraduate and desire to perform research, but are not in an organized research training program or the Honors College, it is still possible to do so here on the UTSA campus. In fact, you even earn credit through honors research courses (you no longer have to be in the Honors College to take them), Independent Study courses, or through other internships that may be available in your department.\n",
      "What you need for any of these mechanisms is a faculty member (often referred to as a PI, or Principal Investigator) who will accept you into his or her laboratory or work group. Below is some advice on how to approach a faculty member to seek a position in their lab.\n",

      "Approaching a Prospective Research Mentor\n",
      "\n",
      "You can approach prospective research mentors directly (during office hours or after class if you're in one of their classes) or through email. If you choose to send an email, send two or three of the researchers you selected above (but not to all at once) a short individual email giving a (very) brief run-down of your academic background and credentials. Mention your interest in their research and ask if you may set up an appointment with them to discuss a possible volunteer research position with them (or independent study or honors research). Make sure the email is grammatically correct, short, and tailored to their research. If you get no response after a week, send it again. If still no response, you can either try to track them down in person or move on to another person. Professors actually like persistent people... if you give up after one try, you didn't want to perform research with them very much. They also like talking about their research to an interested student, so don't be afraid of speaking to them.\n",
      "Dear Dr. XXXXX,\n",
      "I am a [first, second, third, fourth] year undergraduate XXXXX major. [I want a PhD... I am thinking about a PhD... I am considering graduate school...] and would love to participate in research. I am looking for a laboratory and am very interested in your research on XXXXX. [Maybe a few sentences on why you like their research.] If you are accepting students at this time, I would like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss your research and possible opportunities in your lab. I plan to work in the laboratory for XX semesters, until I graduate.\n",

      "For the meeting, dress normally but be sure to show up on time. The researcher will ask you questions and you should also be prepared to ask them a few questions about their research. They will probably ask you why you want to perform research, why you want to work with them, and what your long term career goals are. You can ask them about what projects might be available for you to assist on (you won't get your own for a while - you will be working with another student or postdoc in the lab).\n",
      "\n",
      "What are Faculty Members Looking for in Future Lab Members?\n",
      "\n",
      "The specifics vary with field and by faculty member, but a minimal time commitment is a must: 15 hours/week is good, 10 might work, less is not workable if you want a project of your own. Other factors are listed below. Please keep in mind, you may be invited to attend lab meetings or to participate in the lab for a trial period; you must prove your reliability. They spend time and resources in their student researchers and you should give them the idea that you would be a good investment.\n",
      "- Are you excited about research and their field? (demonstrates engagement and commitment)\n",
      "- Have you sought out research experiences in the past?\n",
      "- Are you knowledgeable about your coursework in their field?\n",
      "- Did you read and come up with questions about the field or project?\n",
      "- How good is your GPA? (shows knowledge of field and responsibility)\n",
      "- Did you show up on time for the meeting(s)?\n",
      "- Did you persistently pursue the position and hop through any hoops that were created? (persistence is a sign of a good researcher)\n",
      "- Did you attend meetings/activities that you were told to attend?\n",
      "- Did you read assigned papers and fight to understand them?\n",
      "After your meeting, they may also take you for a tour of the lab (if they have one) or tell you about a project. Sometimes, rather than offering you a position, you may be given something to do (e.g. read a paper, etc.) and they will want to meet with you again; this could be a test so make sure that you do what is assigned. It will show that you're very serious about entering the lab.\n",
      "If you are offered a position and you have a very good feeling about it, go for it. If they say that you can start on a certain day but then don't get back to you, then you need to get back to them and pursue your opportunity. If you are offered a position but are uncertain about a laboratory, thank them very much for the meeting and ask if you may get back to them within a few days. Get back to them. If you do not choose their lab, always remember to send an email thanking them for their time.\n",

      "In general, programs are looking for students with the appropriate academic coursework, a solid GPA (3.5 or above), solid Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores, a mentored research experience, strong recommendations from research mentors, and research interests that are compatible with institutional research emphases. Please note, however, that admissions to graduate school can be flexible; for students with an exceptional research background and letters, admission with a lower GPA or GRE score can occur, particularly if their grades are strong in upper division major courses. Quite a few students with lower GPAs (though seldom below a 3.0) have been admitted to very good doctoral programs. Further, the focus paid to GRE scores varies by graduate institution, so never count yourself out if you have GRE issues.\n",

      "Doctoral Training\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctoral training takes place at academic institutions such as universities and medical centers. Doctoral training is unique in that after about two years, structured coursework is completed and students are primarily devoted to the research projects that they have proposed. Normally, there is not a set time for the award of the doctorate, but students commonly complete their work and defend their doctoral dissertation within four to six years of study. A particularly compelling aspect of doctoral education in the sciences represented by the College of Sciences is the fact that it is not a financial burden to the student. Tuition, fees, and even living expenses for doctoral trainees in the sciences are generally covered by their research mentor, department fellowships or teaching assistantships, or through pre-doctoral grant proposals that trainees themselves can write. The source of these funds can vary with time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctoral Training Programs\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctoral training programs have diverse emphases and entry requirements, so students seeking admission will need to consult their programs of interest. Of particular note is the fact that a majority of Ph.D. programs in the sciences do not require prior completion of a Master's degree if a student has received adequate undergraduate research preparation. Other fields in engineering (except biomedical engineering), psychology, and kinesiology do require completion of master's education; please check into this when you are exploring individual fields. For many Ph.D. programs, a Master's degree may help with admission, but never count yourself out from direct application following undergraduate studies if you have at least a year of research experience and strong letters of recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctoral Preparation\n",
      "\n",
      "UTSA coursework generally provides a strong foundation for future doctoral studies with the selection of appropriate electives. There are many mechanisms for obtaining research experience during undergraduate education at UTSA which are summarized here. Briefly, students perform research by volunteering, or through participation in the Honors College, College or Departmental Honors, Independent Study courses, and a variety of organized research training programs. Summer research is also an option, with funded positions available at UTSA and at academic, industry, and government institutions throughout the world.\n",

      "Professor and Chair, Department of Chemistry\n",
      "Dr. Audrey Lamb is a professor of chemistry at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Dr. Lamb received her bachelors of science in chemistry from Furman University in 1993, her doctorate in biochemistry at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1998, and performed postdoctoral studies in biochemistry at Northwestern University. She was hired as an assistant professor in the department of Molecular Biosciences at the University of Kansas in 2003 where she rose through the ranks to full professor in 2015, and served as interim dean of graduate studies in 2019. Dr. Lamb moved to UTSA in 2020 to become the Chair of the Chemistry Department.\n",
      "The research of Dr. Lamb's laboratory focuses on understanding how bacteria cause disease in humans for the development of effective therapeutics. Her lab studies how human pathogens biosynthesize metallophores, molecules produced by bacteria to scavenge required metal ions from the environment, including the human host. The lab also studies how Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is made by human pathogens. In both cases, the lab uses mechanistic enzymology and structural biology to investigate the enzymes of these biosynthetic pathways, which are targets for the design of new antibiotics. Dr. Lamb also has collaborative projects related to cancer, diabetes, and SARS-CoV-2, among others. She has received funding from numerous sources, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the American Lung Association, and the W.M. Keck Foundation.\n",
      "Dr. Lamb has run regional and national meetings, including the Midwest Enzyme Chemistry Conference and the Enzymes, Coenzymes and Metabolic Pathways Gordon Research Conference. In January of 2024, she will serve as co-chair of the Enzymes Mechanisms Conference. She is currently an elected council member for the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Dr. Lamb was elected as a 2022 Fellow for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\n",
      "Dr. Lamb's first love is inspiring young minds in the sciences, and she has mentored many undergraduate, masters, and doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows. Indeed, she is an award-winning teacher and mentor at the undergraduate and graduate levels.\n",

      "Riboflavin is required by all living organisms and is synthesized from one GTP and two ribulose 5-phosphate molecules using five unique enzymes. The chemistry at work in this pathway is specialized and involves enzymes that have no paralogs. Despite the unparalleled chemistry and the ubiquitous requirement for riboflavin, compelling evidence for the chemical mechanisms of the enzymes in this biosynthetic pathway has not been presented. We are working to fill that gap in knowledge. The results will provide key information for other researchers who work toward the generation of novel antimicrobials in the fight against multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens, and for parasitic pathogens dependent on bacterial symbionts to generate the vitamin riboflavin.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death and affects one in every 10 individuals aged 65 or older in the United States. In the disease, there are an increased number of dangerous molecules called free radicals that can cripple and kill cells within the brain, causing dementia. This damaging process is called oxidative stress.\n",
      "Dr. Perry's research is primarily focused on how cells in the brain respond to the presence of these free radicals. Looking at how the cells react is like looking through a window into the disease.\n",
      "Dr. Perry is currently working to determine what causes the increased amount of free radicals and what leads to the damage they cause. Figuring out how the brain's cells respond to free radicals is critical to interrupting the progress of the disease and could lead to new interventions in patients as young as those in their 30s and 40s.\n",

      "Lead by postdoc Dr. Andrea Kelley, one of the lab's primary research goals is to develop new ways to analyze Alzheimer's disease pathologies and identify key biochemical areas which may help in future drug interventions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most researched diseases in the world; however, so much is still unknown about the mechanisms of its onset and progression.\n",
      "Our research focuses on the use of mass spectrometry, a powerful analytical technique, to develop a clearer picture of the mechanisms at work in the development of senile plaques in AD brains. Senile plaques are thought to be primarily made up of amyloid-betapeptides but our methods have confirmed that the plaques are actually much more complex than previously believed. With the application of imaging mass spectrometry, which combines the mass analysis of mass spectrometry and the visual of classic microscopy, we can begin to understand, at the molecular level, the underlying players in AD etiology and how the disease-state brain really differs from a normal brain.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this article I hope to convince you that the curriculum for chemistry is in drastic need of revision and that Organic Chemistry should be a cornerstone for introducing students to the wealth of excitement and discovery that exists in our discipline. I will also tell you that we have a great need for new and innovative approaches to chemistry education, especially in Organic Chemistry, that bring students to an awareness of the challenges and opportunities that exist in the \"central science.\" Finally, I will comment on the specific components of Organic Chemistry, including its laboratory program, that are in need of revitalization.\n",
      "General Chemistry and the Core Curriculum for Chemistry\n",
      "The traditional core curriculum for chemistry programs begins with an introduction to chemistry that is normally devoted to chemical principles and their applications. The introductory course serves a broad clientele, from potential chemistry and biology majors to engineering, premedicine, nursing, and a variety of other pre-professional students. It is, in fact, a major \"service course\" in colleges and universities, one that has politically, at least in the United States, justified a significant portion of chemistry faculty size and budgetary support.\n",
      "The design of the introductory chemistry course originally provided an overview of the discipline with content distributed to highlight the major fields of disciplinary development. Then, and I am now speaking of a time prior to 1960, it was not uncommon to find inorganic chemistry integrated with physical and analytical principles, although organic chemistry, except in examples used for combustion, hybridization, and weak acids, among others, was left until the end, and often omitted. Introductory chemistry was intended to bring to all students a common background and understanding, although anyone who has taught such a course quickly comes to the realization that students who complete the course in introductory chemistry do so with vastly different levels of understanding. Indeed, although expectations are often lower and quantitative principles are taught to two significant figures rather than four, the high school course in chemistry covers virtually the same material as does the first year college course.\n",
      "We must recognize that students who enter college motivated and/or prepared to enter a career in which chemistry is a prerequisite are being pulled in many directions. When they see chemistry as a science of atomic structure, molecular orbital theory, molarities, solubility products, and gas constants, how can they begin to understand its role in the discovery and design of new materials for the transmission of information, the synthesis of complex biologically important structures, or the detection, characterization, and quantification of chemical species at sub-picogram levels in environmental analyses?\n",
      "- elementary and intermediate inorganic chemistry\n",
      "- elementary chemical analysis and instrumental methods of analysis\n",
      "- fundamentals of organic chemistry, including bioorganic chemistry\n",
      "- principles of physical chemistry, including thermodynamics and equilibria, chemical kinetics, introductory quantum and statistical mechanics, and spectroscopy\n",
      "- synthesis and characterization of inorganic and organic compounds\n",
      "- experimental physical chemistry\n",
      "- Laboratory instruction should include practical experience with instrumentation for spectroscopy, separation techniques, electrochemical methods, and computerized data acquisition and analysis.\n",
      "Organic Chemistry as a Cornerstone of Chemical Education\n",
      "There is a wealth of organized knowledge about chemistry in the Introductory Organic Chemistry course, and the beauty of its expression lies in the integration of principles and their applications, of structure, dynamics, and synthesis. No other subdiscipline of chemistry possesses the uniformity of content that characterizes the first course in Organic Chemistry. Principles of chemistry are explained through applications with compounds containing carbon and hydrogen rather than with examples that span the breadth of the periodic table.\n",
      "Organic Chemistry is the first course from which a 3-dimensional view of molecules is of fundamental importance for student understanding. Chirality as a concept and structural design is most often introduced for the first time in that course and integrated into chemical reactions and their mechanisms. From this essential 3-dimensional understanding of molecular structure, taken together with molecular geometry and conformational flexibility, comes the realization that chemistry is indeed central to understanding complex biological processes and the rigid designs that are the essential elements of molecular devices.\n",
      "With engineering students expected in most cases, among students who are drawn to a career in which chemistry is a prerequisite, the vast majority are best served by an introductory course in Organic Chemistry. Students interested in molecular biology, in medicine, in nutrition, and in petroleum geology, among others, would find added stimulus from chemistry introduced by Organic Chemistry. Even for students who are not oriented to these careers, Organic Chemistry holds principles and understandings that are fundamental to chemistry but are often overlooked in a General Chemistry course.\n",
      "Problems with Organic Chemistry\n",
      "\"The course is too detailed. The textbooks, now more than 1200 pages, are too long.\" So say many students who have passed through this demanding course. Organic Chemistry is filled with factual information – 20 ways to synthesize an alkene and 40 reactions of alkenes, for example – often to the exclusion of the very principles that have characterized its unique importance.\n",
      "\"There is nothing worthwhile left to discover in Organic Chemistry\" is another comment that is expressed too often. How exciting is the discovery of a new way of making cyclohexene when there are ten alternative methods? Missing from most textbooks and even lectures are descriptions of the relative importance of specific methodologies. Too few examples of the applications of Organic Chemistry to societal uses and problems exist in textbooks.\n",
      "There is a core knowledge that all students who undertake a course in Organic Chemistry should understand, and that core is not devoted solely to factual details. Comprehensive chemical knowledge is expanding exponentially, and those details that are relevant to a particular problem are often changing faster than one’s ability to absorb them. Consequently, our students are served better by an educational emphasis on concepts with examples that appropriately highlight this basic framework and attract their interest. With a firm grasp of these fundamentals, students can then draw from the organized body of chemical knowledge those facts that are relevant to the solution of a particular problem.\n",
      "Standardized examinations, which are so popular in professional training, have prompted Organic Chemistry’s emphasis on factual information. The effectiveness of a course in Organic Chemistry is often judged by its ability to include those specific items of information that are included in multiple choice examinations, and less often on the relevance of the information to chemistry or to society. In the United States the standardized Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) has influenced too much of the content of the Organic Chemistry course, although the absence of a separate examination for chemistry in the near future will minimize its importance and, with its absence, the relevance of chemistry for a career in medicine.\n",
      "The pressure of standardized examinations and the basic conservatism of instructors provide a resistance to change the content of a course in Organic Chemistry. Many of you can recall your own introduction to the \"Wurtz reaction,\" even in the 1960’s, as one of the five basic methods for the synthesis of alkanes. How many textbooks still treat carbonyl condensation reactions basically the same was as they were described 40 years ago?\n",
      "Textbooks for Organic Chemistry are today almost as numerous as those for General Chemistry. Virtually all of them are organized according to functional groups, although differences do exist in their relative placement. Because of the excessive production costs of a new textbook, new and potentially innovative approaches are discouraged, and this further jeopardizes change. Could a \"Cram and Hammond\" be published today? I think not.\n",
      "The laboratory program for Organic Chemistry continues in most institutions as a test tube science without student access to the basic chromatographic and spectroscopic instrumentation that are so essential to the rapid advances that have characterized this science. As a consequence, students view Organic Chemistry as it existed more than thirty years ago, and their enthusiasm has diminished. The recent attention given to micro-scale laboratories has been a valuable development, especially in reducing laboratory costs and waster disposal problems, but this approach can only be effective if students have access to the instrumentation necessary for characterization and evaluation of purity.\n",
      "Organic Chemistry in the Year 2000\n",
      "Significant changes have taken place in the chemistry curriculum since 1989. Driven in part by the lowest enrollments in the previous four decades occurring for the years 1993-1996, chemistry departments now permit students to enroll in Organic Chemistry as their first college chemistry course. The course begins with a thorough examination of the chemical structure of carbon-containing compounds in which the basic principles of orbitals and bonding, geometry and stereochemistry are discussed. The predictive properties of these compounds follow with emphasis placed on physical and spectral properties for isolation and characterization, although sensory effects that include taste and odor are beginning to be described in an increasing number of institutional courses. The energetics of chemical transformations focuses on combustion and acidity, and here the course introduces thermodynamic principles and the solution chemistry of weak acids.\n",
      "Although older textbooks are still organized according to the functional groups of organic compounds, those introduced during the past four years have taken quite diverse approaches in order to capture the fragmented market. The newer textbooks are less then 1000 pages in length, and they can be purchased on protected diskettes that allow students to supplement textual materials with information obtained in lectures. Supplementary materials include the traditional problem solution manual, but, in what is perhaps the most striking innovation, special topics chapters are produced for specific institutions, either in textbook format or on diskette, to supplement the core topics according to the interests of individual instructors or programs.\n",
      "The functional group approach for Organic Chemistry is, in the year 2000, employed for the first time in describing chemical reactions and their uses for synthesis. Fewer functional groups are described in this introductory course, and less time is devoted to the chemistry of aromatic compounds. However, biologically relevant molecules, especially carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleic acids, are introduced early and integrated liberally within the course structure. The structures, properties, and syntheses of polymers are also integral components of this introductory course.\n",
      "Gone from the Organic Chemistry course are many of the reactions that were previously described in virtually all Organic Chemistry textbooks. The Fischer Proof for the relative stereochemistry of monosaccharides can no longer be found in the newer organic textbooks. The preparation and reactions of sulfur compounds are now a special topics chapter. Oximes and hydrazones are also missing subjects. Greater emphasis is now placed on stereospecific reactions, and comparisons are made to enzyme controlled reactions. The use of plasmids for chemical synthesis is introduced as an emerging area for development at the interface of chemistry and biology.\n",
      "In the Organic Chemistry Laboratory micro-scale organic methods are integrated into virtually all programs. Students routinely use capillary gas chromatographs with built-in integrators for their analyses of purity and GC/MS, FT-IR and FT-NMR for structural identification. As a result of the availability of this instrumentation, individual laboratory experiments rely less on simple organic compounds and, instead, employ more complex naturally occurring compounds and stereospecific reactions. Many institutions, by the year 2000, have integrated organic and inorganic chemistry laboratories into a course sequence in chemical synthesis.\n",
      "Because of the changes in the chemistry curriculum that have taken place since 1989, the percentage of students who major in chemistry, which was 0.7 in 1995, is now 1.2. Enrollments in introductory courses are now 50 percent greater than they were in 1995. Employment opportunities in chemistry and chemistry-related areas, even with these increases, remain high.\n",

      "Pd-Catalyzed Synthesis of Substituted Allenes\n",
      "The discovery and development of new catalytic asymmetric methodologies remains a fundamental challenge and priority in organic synthesis. Despite the incredible repertoire of chiral catalysts available (either metal-based or carbon-based) and the increasing ability to rationally design new ones, critical gaps still remain in several areas of asymmetric synthesis including the catalytic construction of axial chirality. Nowhere is this gap more obvious than in the synthesis of chiral allenes. My group has a long-term goal to exploit metal-mediated beta-hydride eliminations as a powerful new approach in synthetic methodology and asymmetric catalysis. Towards this goal, we have developed several Pd-catalyzed syntheses of substituted allenes that are highlighted above in Figure 1. Early work involved the use of stereodefined enol triflates to access substituted allenoates in both racemic and enantioenriched forms. Our current work involves the discovery and development of the alkynyl Heck reaction as one of the most direct syntheses of allenes known. Key to the success of this approach was the design of a new hybrid Pd(0)-catalyst, BobCat, that was invented in our labs here at UTSA.\n",
      "Developing Highly Efficient Metal-Catalyzed Direct Borylation and Cross-Coupling Reactions\n",
      "For several years now, we have developed a fruitful collaboration with the Chemical Synthesis & Development (CSD) group at BMS. Our latest efforts are focusing on developing a \"users-guide\" to Pd and Ni-catalyzed borylations and subsequent Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. Key to this effort is the identification of optimized reaction parameters that provide high conversion at very low catalyst loadings (i.e., ‹ 1 mol %) for the borylation step, the Suzuki reaction, or both. At these low catalyst loadings, we are also pursuing \"late-stage\" borylations and Suzuki reaction to functionalize complex molecules and APIs.\n",

      "In collaboration with Dr. April Risinger at UT Health San Antonio, we are developing new synthetic routes to simplified analogs of the taccalonolides as potential new treatments for triple negative breast cancer. Naturally occurring taccalonolides (and semi-synthetic derivatives) are highly complex, steroid-based natural products that have proven microtubule-stabilizing activity that is complementary to the taxanes yet overcome various mechanisms of resistance. As such, they are attractive targets for cancer drug discovery yet their complexity precludes their pre-clinical development beyond academic endeavors. Thanks to funding from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), we have synthesized simplified analogs of the taccas that demonstrate promising cytotoxic profiles against various cancer cells lines. Our continuing efforts are focused on developing new analogs that contain the entire carbon framework of the taccas that are synthetically tractable and exhibit microtubule stabilizing activity relevant to pursue their pre-clinical development.\n",

Samples are collected over a 24 hour period (representing a “composite”) on a weekly basis from the “headworks,” the location where all of the sewage enters the treatment plant. Samples are tested to detect and measure SARS‑CoV‑2, the virus that causes COVID‑19.\n",

The daily number of newly reported COVID‑19 cases in Bexar County appear alongside the 7-day moving average of new cases.

Many people who come to the U.S. on J–1 visas are subject to the Two–Year Home Country Residency requirement. For most, this is because they have received government financing for their program (from either the home country or the U.S.), or they are on the Exchange Visitors Skills List. For more information on this requirement or how it can be waived, see an international student and scholar advisor in the Office of International Programs. Eligibility criteria - Invitation to teach, lecture or conduct collaborative research - Indication of adequate financial support for length of program Possible income from U.S. sources - Unlimited income for work on campus in pursuit of academic objective - Off-campus work allowed only for occasional lectures and consultations with prior approval from the Office of International Programs Maximum length of stay in U.S. - Five years Advantages - Relatively easy and quick to obtain - Spouses may work with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approval and/or go to school full time Disadvantages - May be subject to two-year home residence requirement based on funding, or skills list. - Cannot change program objective Supporting documentation needed by International Services for issuing DS-2019 - Scholars resume - Evidence of financial support for the length of program - English Language Proficiency - J-1 visa application documents request form Supporting documentation needed by U.S. Embassy for issuing J-1 visa - DS-2019 issued by UTSA International Services - Passport(s) - Travel itinerary, if any - Dates of last visits or trips to U.S., if any UTSA hiring form needed Global Initiatives International Students Study Abroad Graduate School and Research Building, GSR 2.116 Main Campus 1 UTSA Circle San Antonio, TX 78249 UTSA's Mission The University of Texas at San Antonio is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge through research and discovery, teaching and learning, community engagement and public service.

The training program is primarily housed within the UTSA Department of Interdisciplinary Teaching and includes faculty and students from across disciplines who are conducting Educational Science research. The founded training program aims to: 1. Provide undergraduate juniors with experiences in conducting Educational Science research with a focus on P-20 Pipeline Issues while preparing participants for doctoral study, and 2. Help increase diversity in the educational science fields. Please provide us your contact information and you will receive a personal link to apply to the program Name Email Message Send P-20 Pathways Theme Here are some of our fellows’ research statements: Through my research I will be able to gain knowledge of strategies and practices I can implement in my own classroom to ensure that students from inequitable backgrounds are able to thrive academically and emotionally. KRISTA SCHMIDT I want to focus my research on alternative pedagogical methods because of the current educational system. Teachers are only required to have 70% of their students passing standardized tests. Therefore, I want to be able to change this system by researching an educational paradigm shift where educators take approaches from special education into the mainstream classroom. NATHAN VALDEZ As a society, we place a big emphasis on educational backgrounds, but foster care students are usually left out of the conversation. These children not only change schools often, they change geographical locations, more than that they change families. I am working on a way to make their education a source of continuity in their life. I am working on giving them agency over their education. K.
